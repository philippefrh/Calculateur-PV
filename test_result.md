# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Key findings: 1) API endpoint /api/solar-kits is fully operational and returns correct data structure with all 7 kits (3kW-9kW). 2) Each kit contains expected fields: price and panels count (3kW: 14900€/6 panels, 4kW: 20900€/8 panels, 5kW: 21900€/10 panels, 6kW: 22900€/12 panels, 7kW: 24900€/14 panels, 8kW: 26900€/16 panels, 9kW: 29900€/18 panels). 3) Frontend fetchAvailableKits function (lines 419-463 in App.js) correctly calls ${API}/solar-kits endpoint and processes response. 4) Data transformation logic working properly: calculates surface totale (panels × 2.1m²), aids (autoconsumption + TVA), and final pricing. 5) Previous testing in test_result.md confirms kit selection functionality was already working. 6) The URL correction has resolved the issue that was preventing kit display. 7) All required kit information displays correctly: power, panels, surface totale, prix TTC, prix avec aides déduites, and 'CO2 économisé: 2500 kilos/an'. 8) Kit selection, confirmation, and indicator functionality all operational. The fetchAvailableKits correction is working perfectly and the kit selection feature is ready for production use."

    message: "✅ AUTOCONSUMPTION/SURPLUS DISTRIBUTION (95%/5%) SUCCESSFULLY TESTED - The modified calculation from 70% autoconsumption / 30% surplus to 95% autoconsumption / 5% surplus is working perfectly. Test results: 6529 kWh autoconsumption (95.0%), 344 kWh surplus (5.0%) from 6873 kWh total production. Monthly savings increased significantly from 113.93€ (old method) to 139.07€ (new method), representing +25.14€/month (+22.1% improvement). Economic impact verified: New method (production × 0.95 × 0.2516) + (production × 0.05 × 0.076) provides much better balance with financing payments (125.36€/month with aids). The new distribution makes solar installations significantly more economically attractive as requested."
