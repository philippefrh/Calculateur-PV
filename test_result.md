# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

RESULTS: ✅ ALL 7 CALCULATION MODES TESTS PASSED (100% success rate). 1) ✅ Default Mode Verification: Calling calculate endpoint without calculation_mode parameter correctly defaults to 'realistic' mode (192.57€/month, 67.6% real savings). 2) ✅ Explicit Realistic Mode: calculation_mode=realistic returns expected lower savings (~192€/month, 67.6% real savings). 3) ✅ Explicit Optimistic Mode: calculation_mode=optimistic returns expected higher savings (~287€/month, 100.9% real savings). 4) ✅ Response Structure: API response correctly includes calculation_mode and calculation_config fields with all required parameters. 5) ✅ Mode Comparison: Significant difference between modes (+95.05€/month, +49.4% increase, +33.4% real savings difference). 6) ✅ Default vs Explicit Consistency: Default call (no mode) gives identical results to explicit realistic mode. 7) ✅ Used test data: Pascal Lopez client (8255 kWh/an consumption, 285€/month EDF payment) for consistency. The default mode change from 'optimistic' to 'realistic' is working perfectly and meets all requirements from the review request."

RESULTS: ✅ ALL REQUESTED CHANGES IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY. 1) ✅ Mode Selector Changes: Mode selector now shows 'Etude 1' and 'Etude 2' instead of 'Mode Réaliste' and 'Mode Optimiste'. Backend API confirmed: realistic mode = 'Etude 1', optimistic mode = 'Etude 2'. 2) ✅ Header Removal: Header 'Mode de calcul' and description 'Choisissez le mode de calcul des économies' successfully removed from selector. 3) ✅ Mode Switching: Both modes work correctly with different calculation results. Etude 2 shows higher savings than Etude 1 as expected. 4) ✅ Results Screen Title: Results header now shows 'SYNTHESE et RESULTAT FINAL DES CALCULS' instead of old calculation mode titles. 5) ✅ Financing Duration Rounding: Duration values properly rounded to ≤1 decimal place (e.g., '7.2 ans' instead of '7.166666667 ans'). 6) ✅ Full Workflow: Successfully completed form steps 1-3, mode switching functionality verified. All UI changes meet the requirements from the review request and are ready for production use."
