The trajectory details the work of a previous AI engineer on the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, transitioning from critical bug fixes to extensive UI/UX enhancements. Initially, the engineer resolved issues such as premature screen advancement, navigation malfunctions, backend geocoding timeouts with a fallback, financial calculation inconsistencies post-manual kit selection, and region-specific kit lookup errors. This established a stable MVP. Subsequently, the focus shifted entirely to enriching the solar animation page. The engineer iteratively added a realistic sun, a real-time kWh counter with a Linky meter, integrated a permanent mobile app display with synchronized production/consumption values, and finally, an animated sequence showing accumulating banknotes representing savings. The work demonstrates a strong ability to interpret abstract user ideas into concrete animated features, continuously refining the visual experience.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application aims to be a comprehensive solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial needs included specific PDF enhancements, a solid green background with animations, and UI consistency, shifting focus from AI-driven Roof Analysis to a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation () that displays after a 20-second Calcul terminé avec succès screen and navigates to the financial summary.

Recent work has heavily focused on enhancing the  page. Key animation feature requests by the user include:
1.  A realistic, animated shining sun in the top-left corner.
2.  A real-time kWh counter (Linky meter) appearing after all solar panels are installed, with kWh figures floating from panels into the meter.
3.  The Linky meter and mobile phone display remaining visible throughout the animation, with the Linky meter being the same size as the phone.
4.  A black cable connecting the last installed panel to the Linky meter.
5.  The mobile phone screen displaying green (production) and red (consumption) kWh, with green increasing faster.
6.  A final visual sequence featuring the text Autoconsommation = Economies directement sur votre Facture followed by animated banknotes stacking up.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on enhancing the  page, transforming it into a rich, pedagogical visualization of solar energy production and savings.

The engineer successfully implemented:
1.  **Animated Sun**: A realistic, golden/yellow sun positioned in the top-left, featuring continuous rotation, subtle pulsing rays, and a glowing aura, integrated into  and styled in .
2.  **Real-time kWh Production & Linky Meter**: After all solar panels are installed, small kWh numbers now float from each panel and travel towards a realistically designed Linky meter. The Linky meter's digital screen dynamically displays increasing kWh values in real-time, along with a blinking green LED. This required significant updates to  and .
3.  **Persistent Mobile App Display**: The mobile phone visual remains on screen throughout the entire animation, providing a continuous monitoring aspect.
4.  **Production/Consumption Synchronization on Phone**: The phone's screen now shows two sets of real-time kWh values: rapidly increasing green kWh (production) and slowly increasing red kWh (consumption), visually demonstrating energy balance.
5.  **Cable Connection**: A black cable is visually rendered, connecting the last solar panel to the Linky meter, enhancing realism.
6.  **Economy Visualization**: The text Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture is displayed, followed by an animation of banknotes progressively stacking, vividly illustrating financial benefits.

The application now features a comprehensive energy chain: Sun → Panels → kWh particles → Cable → Linky Meter → Mobile App → Banknotes. The  and  files have undergone extensive modifications to accommodate these complex animations and elements. The most recent internal check identified a mobile app duplication issue, which was resolved.

The last user request (Chat Message 81) indicates a need for further adjustments to the visual layout and specifics of the banknote animation, which is the immediate next task.

<optional_next_step>
Adjust the mobile phone position to the right, resize the Linky meter to match the phone's size without overlapping panels, create space between them for animated banknotes, and reposition the Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text.
