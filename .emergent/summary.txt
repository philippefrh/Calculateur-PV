The AI engineer's work within this trajectory primarily focused on two distinct phases of refining the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. Initially, the core task was to implement and debug a progressive battery charge/discharge animation, as explicitly requested by the user. This involved iterative attempts at refining the animation logic in  and corresponding visual adjustments in , including precise sizing and positioning of UI elements.

Despite multiple efforts on the animation, the application encountered a critical blocking issue related to loading solar kits. This led to the second major phase: diagnosing and resolving front-end display bugs related to financial calculations when the battery feature was active. The AI engineer successfully identified and fixed issues causing empty Reste à financer and Investissement après aides fields, and incorrect pricing in Options de financement, ensuring all displayed values correctly reflected the  including the battery cost. The work concluded with the user confirming the financial display fixes.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application targets clients in France and Martinique for solar calculation and quote generation. It features dynamic CSS 3D solar animations, Martinique-specific pricing (TTC, TVA, interest), and solar kits ranging from 12kW to 27kW, complemented by governmental aids and a three-tier discount system. The application requires the CSS animation to auto-display post-Carré VERT positif success screen after a 7-second delay. Financial logic was refined for better alignment with monthly savings, and an Économie column was added.

The latest successfully implemented feature prior to this trajectory was an optional green Batterie button, adding 5000€ to the kit price and visually integrating a battery image within the CSS animation. During this trajectory, the user explicitly requested enhancing the battery feature to include a progressive charge/discharge animation (0% to 100% in 5% increments, then inverse, then loop), synchronized with panel production. The green percentage logo had to visually move with the charge, not be hidden by the Linky meter, and the battery image had to be enlarged to match the Linky's size. Subsequent work also addressed financial display inconsistencies introduced by the battery option.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical front-end display issues within the  application, specifically concerning financial calculations when the optional battery storage feature was selected.

The work primarily focused on resolving three identified problems in  (Chat Message 114):
1.  **Reste à financer appearing empty**: This field was not displaying a value.
2.  **Options de financement showing incorrect price**: It displayed 15900€ instead of the correct 20900€ when the battery was selected.
3.  **Investissement après aides appearing empty**: This field in the optimized financing section was blank.

To resolve these, the AI engineer made precise modifications in :
-   For the Options de financement inconsistency, the display logic was updated to ensure that  (which includes the battery cost) was used when  was true, rather than just relying on  (Chat Message 125).
-   For the empty Reste à financer and Investissement après aides fields, the calculation was explicitly set to  (Chat Messages 127, 135, 137). This bypassed issues where  might have been undefined or incorrectly populated, ensuring these critical financial summaries always displayed the correct, calculated values.

Prior to these financial fixes, the AI engineer also spent significant effort on implementing and debugging a progressive battery charge/discharge animation, as requested by the user. This involved multiple refactorings of the animation logic in  and corresponding CSS adjustments in  (e.g., Chat Messages 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 77, 79). Although the animation's code logic was confirmed as working, a broader application blocking issue (Erreur lors du chargement des kits) emerged, leading to the pivot to financial display fixes.
The successful resolution of the financial display bugs was confirmed by the user (Chat Message 143), who stated, parfait ca fonctionne.
