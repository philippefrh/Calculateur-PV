The previous AI engineer successfully brought the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from inception (0 to 1). Initially, the focus was on advanced photorealistic solar panel visualization using , which later pivoted to a local OpenCV/PIL solution due to technical constraints. Subsequent efforts streamlined the application's flow, re-integrating a free CSS animation with auto-launch features and refining financing calculations. The most recent and critical work, as detailed in the provided trajectory, involved implementing an optional battery storage feature. This task encompassed adding a 5000€ cost increase to solar kits, introducing a Batterie button in the UI, and visually integrating a battery image into the CSS animation. The trajectory highlights a robust debugging process where a critical bug related to the battery's price not reflecting in the frontend, despite correct backend calculation, was identified and resolved. The AI engineer also addressed the user's feedback to adjust the battery image's size in the animation. This concluded with comprehensive testing, confirming the full functionality and correct display of the battery feature across the application.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool designed for clients in France and Martinique. Its primary purpose is to provide dynamic CSS 3D solar animations, accurate Martinique-specific pricing (TTC, TVA, interest), and offer solar kits ranging from 12kW to 27kW, complemented by governmental aids and a three-tier discount system.

Initially, a key feature involved superimposing realistic black solar panels onto client house photos, demanding precise 3D perspective and dimensions (1.71m H x 1.10m W) to maintain the original house perspective and ensure professional aesthetics. This visualization was intended to guide accurate calculations and kit selection.

More recently, the user prioritized the existing CSS animation, requesting its automatic display after the Carré VERT positif success screen with a 7-second delay. Financial logic was refined to better align financing durations with monthly savings, and an Économie column was added to financial tables.

The latest requirement, which has been successfully implemented and verified, was the introduction of an optional green Batterie button. When selected, this option increases the kit price by 5000€ and visually integrates a battery image within the CSS animation, positioned between the solar panels and the Linky meter. All existing application functionalities were required to be preserved throughout these updates.

-   ****: Important for backend configuration, stores  and .
-   ****: The core backend logic.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API routes, solar solution calculations, financing, and image processing.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented  parameter in  and  to add 5000€ to  when selected. The  status is also included in the API response. Its calculation logic for battery pricing was confirmed to be correct.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies, including , , and .

    -   **Importance**: Manages UI, state, user flow, kit selection, and calculation initiation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Before this trajectory, it handled auto-transition to CSS animation, financing logic, and Économie column. For the battery feature, it introduced  state,  function, logic to adjust kit price by +5000€ if battery is selected (), and sending  to backend (, ). A Batterie button was added, and price displays updated. In the current trajectory, the critical fix involved modifying price display logic to consistently use  (which includes battery cost) for the Investissement section and other relevant price outputs, resolving the issue where the 5000€ was not always shown.
-   ****: Defines global application styles.
    -   **Importance**: Styles various UI elements, including the battery button.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added styles for the  and its selected state.
-   ****: React component for CSS animation.
    -   **Importance**: Renders the dynamic 3D solar panel animation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated a conditional  for the battery image (), whose visibility is controlled by the  prop, and rendered via a base64 encoded string.
-   ****: Styles for the CSS animation.
    -   **Importance**: Controls the visual presentation of elements within the solar animation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added CSS rules for  to position and display the battery image. During this trajectory, these rules were specifically adjusted to increase the size of the battery image to match the Linky meter and phone.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively involved in finalizing and debugging the optional battery storage feature as per user feedback.

On the **backend** (), it was confirmed that the  API endpoint correctly processed the  parameter, accurately adding 5000€ to . Backend functionality for this feature was verified as correct and did not require further modifications during this phase of debugging.

The primary focus of the work during this trajectory was on the **frontend** to address two critical issues reported by the user:
1.  **Incorrect Price Display**: In , the pricing display logic was flawed. Although the backend correctly calculated  (which includes the battery cost), the frontend sometimes used  (which did not include the battery cost) for display, particularly when no other discounts were applied. The AI engineer corrected this by ensuring that the  and other key price displays consistently referenced  or a calculated equivalent that properly factored in the battery cost, regardless of the presence of discounts. This involved targeted edits in the rendering sections of .
2.  **Battery Image Size**: In , the visual size of the battery image within the CSS animation was too small, as per user feedback. The AI engineer adjusted the CSS rules for the  element to increase its dimensions, making it visually proportionate to other elements like the Linky meter and phone in the animation.

After implementing these fixes, comprehensive testing was performed. Backend tests using  re-confirmed the correct calculation. Frontend tests using  verified that the battery button functioned, the price displayed correctly across all scenarios (with and without discounts), and the battery image appeared at the requested larger size in the animation. The  file was successfully updated to document these corrections and their verification. The previous AI engineer concluded by asking the user for further enhancements.
