The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing the  page of the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. Initially, general bug fixes stabilized the MVP. Subsequently, the engineer iteratively implemented a realistic sun, real-time kWh counter with a Linky meter, integrated a mobile app display with synchronized data, and an animated sequence of accumulating banknotes. The most recent phase involved precise visual adjustments: repositioning the Linky meter and phone, resizing them, adjusting banknote fall and stacking behavior, and changing logo background colors to green with white text. A significant challenge was the integration of a power cable from the solar panels to the Linky meter; despite multiple attempts and adjustments based on user feedback regarding its position and appearance (from panel 12, then 18, connection point), the user ultimately decided to abandon the cable entirely due to its unnatural look. The final state reflects an aesthetically pleasing and functional animation with all elements except the cable, concluding the requested visual enhancements.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. The initial build focused on PDF enhancements, a solid green background, UI consistency, and a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation displays after a Calcul terminé avec succès screen and leads to a financial summary. Recent user requirements for the  page centered on visual enhancements: an animated sun; a real-time kWh Linky meter appearing after panel installation with floating kWh figures; persistent, same-sized Linky meter and mobile phone display with a connecting cable; synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh values on the phone; and a final visual sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text followed by animated banknotes stacking up. The latest task involved repositioning the mobile phone to the right, resizing the Linky meter to match the phone while ensuring no panel overlap, creating central space for animated banknotes, and displaying the Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text within a new badge, styled identically to the Installation terminée ! Système opérationnel ! logo. The user also explicitly requested the Linky meter be moved near the phone, the cable from the last panel to the Linky meter (initially Panel 12, then Panel 18, connected to the bottom of the Linky), banknotes falling one by one to form a stack above the Voir les Résultats Détaillés button, and both Installation terminée ! and Autoconsommation = Économies logos to have a green background (like the ground) with white text. The cable was ultimately removed.

    -   **Changes Made**: Added CSS styles for the new financing button and various elements for the enhanced solar animation, including sun, Linky meter, kWh particles, cable, and banknotes. This file was updated to accommodate the new positioning of Linky and phone, as well as the badge styling and banknote animations.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: React component for the CSS-based 3D-like animation of solar panels. This file has been the primary focus of recent development and received numerous updates for animation logic and element positioning.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Corrected Retour aux Résultats button  handler.
        -   Integrated sun animation logic, Linky meter component and kWh flow, persistent phone, and cable connection visuals.
        -   Implemented logic for synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh values on the phone screen.
        -   **Recent and Final Changes**: Implemented logic to reposition the phone (), adjusted Linky meter position () to match phone size (200x400px) and create space between them for banknotes. Added a new badge/logo for Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture and its display logic. Updated banknote rendering logic to display specific euro denominations (50€, 20€, 10€, 5€) and their realistic falling and stacking effects by adjusting their positions and timing. Adjusted solar panel positions across different configurations (6, 12, 18 panels) to prevent overlap. Multiple attempts were made to integrate a power cable from panel 12/18 to the Linky meter, but ultimately all cable-related rendering logic and state management were removed. Badge colors were changed to green background with white text.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a series of comprehensive enhancements to the  page, transforming it into a dynamic, pedagogical visualization. The work successfully integrated a realistic, animated sun; a real-time Linky meter displaying increasing kWh values with particles flowing from panels; a persistently visible mobile phone showing synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh; and an animated sequence illustrating financial savings with text and stacking banknotes.

The most recent task, specifically addressing the user's explicit requests, involved significant layout and visual refinements, which were iteratively adjusted:
1.  **Phone Repositioning**: The mobile phone was shifted further to the right ().
2.  **Linky Meter Resizing and Repositioning**: The Linky meter was resized to match the phone's dimensions (200x400px) and repositioned () to avoid overlapping solar panels, while also creating sufficient central space.
3.  **Banknote Space**: The layout now ensures a clear area between the Linky meter and the phone for banknotes to animate.
4.  **New Economy Badge**: A new badge, visually identical to the Installation terminée ! Système opérationnel ! logo, was created to display the text Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture and positioned just below the existing installation badge, appearing during the savings phase. Both this badge and the Installation terminée ! badge were restyled to have a green background (matching the ground) and white text.
5.  **Realistic Banknotes**: The banknotes were refined to display visually distinct, animated euro bills (5€, 10€, 20€, 50€) featuring specific colors and realistic falling/stacking animations within the newly created space, accumulating into a pile above the Voir les Résultats Détaillés button.
6.  **Power Cable**: Multiple attempts were made to draw a power cable connecting the last solar panel (initially panel 12, then specifically panel 18 for the 18-panel configuration) to the bottom of the Linky meter. Despite several iterative adjustments to its position, trajectory, and styling in  and , the user was not satisfied with its appearance and ultimately requested its complete removal.

The current state of the application's animation () has all these elements fully implemented and visually aligned, *excluding* the power cable, which has been removed as per the user's final instruction. The user expressed satisfaction with this version and indicated they would consider future modifications.

<optional_next_step>
The last task, which involved refining the  animation, has been concluded and accepted by the user. No immediate next step is required from the current trajectory.
