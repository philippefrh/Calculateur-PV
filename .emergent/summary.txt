The previous AI engineer successfully brought the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from prototype to a functional tool. Key work included enhancing , updating Martinique's solar panel kit pricing, introducing new kit sizes, revising aid amounts, correcting interest rates, and changing panel wattage to 375W. A significant feature was the implementation and refinement of a discount mechanism, evolving from a single R button to three mutually exclusive options (R1, R2, R3) for €1000, €2000, and €3000 discounts, which are applied in backend calculations but hidden from the final quote. This work concluded with backend validation, but frontend visual testing was paused due to a form validation issue. A new, higher-priority request emerged from the user: to integrate PDF quote generation into the application. The AI engineer successfully analyzed the provided PDF, confirmed technical feasibility, and received user confirmation to proceed with integrating this feature directly into the application, rather than just a one-off PDF modification. The current state awaits user provision of necessary business details for FRH Martinique.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial requirements focused on UI consistency and PDF enhancements, including a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation features an animated sun, a real-time kWh Linky meter, a persistent mobile phone with synchronized kWh values, and an animated sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies text followed by stacking euro banknotes. Specific visual styling includes repositioning the phone (right: 80px), Linky meter (left: 30%, 200x400px), ensuring no panel overlap, and styling Autoconsommation = Économies and Installation terminée ! badges with a green background and white text. A problematic power cable was removed.

Subsequently, the user requested updates to Martinique panel pack pricing: a new list of TTC prices, a confirmed TVA of 2.10%, and a recalculation of the credit interest rate from 8% to 8.63%. This involved updating existing kits (3kW, 6kW, 9kW), adding 6 new kits (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW) with corresponding prices and aid amounts, and adjusting calculations based on a panel power of 375W (instead of 500W). The latest requirement expanded on a discrete R button for a €1000 discount. It now demands three mutually exclusive buttons (R1, R2, R3) on each kit selection card to apply €1000, €2000, or €3000 reductions, respectively. These discounts must reflect in subsequent calculations but must not appear on the final quote. The most recent request is to integrate a PDF quote generation feature into the application, transforming a Syrius Martinique quote PDF by replacing all company-specific details with FRH Martinique information, automating this after each study.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing and testing an enhancement to the discount functionality. The previous single R button for a €1000 discount was replaced with three mutually exclusive buttons: R1 (for €1000), R2 (for €2000), and R3 (for €3000).

On the frontend ( and ), the  component was updated to manage a  state, ensuring only one discount (R1, R2, R3, or none) can be active. The UI was modified to render these distinct buttons, and the price display logic was adjusted to dynamically show the original price (struck through) and the new discounted price. Styles in  were updated to accommodate the new button group and individual button styling. The  and  functions were adapted to pass the selected discount type to the backend.

On the backend (), the  API endpoint was modified to accept a  parameter. The  and  functions were updated to correctly apply this . During backend testing, an issue was identified where monthly payments were not decreasing correctly; this was resolved by fixing  to properly use the optimal financing duration for applying the discount. Backend tests now confirm the R1/R2/R3 discount system works for all kits, with monthly payments correctly reflecting the reductions.

The work is currently at the stage of verifying the frontend implementation. The AI engineer attempted to take screenshots to visually confirm the new buttons and price displays but encountered an error during form navigation, specifically a missing Prénom field in an earlier step of the application flow. The engineer is now blocked on this form validation issue. This work was interrupted by the user's new request regarding PDF generation.

<optional_next_step>
Await the user's provision of FRH Martinique details (company, legal, commercial contact, logo) to proceed with integrating the PDF quote generation functionality into the application, as agreed in the most recent conversation.
