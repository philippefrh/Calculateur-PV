The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the core FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application before shifting focus to a new feature: photorealistic solar panel visualization. Initially,  was integrated, but generative models (, , ) failed to perform direct image editing, instead creating new roofs. This led to a critical pivot to a local OpenCV/PIL solution, eliminating external API dependencies and costs. The subsequent work focused on refining the local rendering: adjusting panel size, ensuring precise positioning without overflow, and critically, achieving accurate 3D perspective and inclination (panels appearing as parallelograms). A persistent challenge remains: the Avant/Après (Before/After) image display, despite numerous attempts to remove it from  and full service restarts, strongly suggesting a deep caching or overlooked frontend rendering issue.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for clients in France and Martinique. It includes a dynamic CSS 3D solar animation and integrates Martinique-specific pricing (TTC, TVA, interest, 12kW-27kW kits with aids). Three mutually exclusive discount buttons (R1: €1000, R2: €2000, R3: €3000) apply to calculations.

A major new feature involves integrating realistic, photorealistic black-colored solar panel placement visualizations on client house photos. The user explicitly requires panels to be superimposed *directly* onto the uploaded client's roof, maintaining the original house and perspective, and not generating a new house or a separate after image. The visualization must show panels with realistic 3D effect, inclination matching the roof slope, correct dimensions (1.71m H x 1.10m W), proper positioning without exceeding roof boundaries, and an overall professional aesthetic matching provided reference photos. The application must correctly calculate, display results, and allow kit selection.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into refining the solar panel visualization feature, having abandoned  for a local OpenCV/PIL approach due to persistent issues with generative AI models not performing direct image editing. The primary goal is to superimpose 16 black solar panels (1.71m H x 1.10m W) onto the user's uploaded roof photo, ensuring they:
1.  Are precisely scaled and positioned to fill the roof area without overflow (current feedback suggests some overflow persists, especially on the bottom right).
2.  Accurately follow the roof's inclination and perspective, appearing as pronounced parallelograms with realistic 3D depth, shadows, and reflections, matching the user's reference photos.
3.  Are displayed as a single, final image on the frontend, rather than a Before/After comparison.

Despite numerous iterative adjustments to the backend's image processing logic in  (including precise margin calculations, 3D transformations, and rendering nuances) and attempts to modify  and restart services, two critical issues persist:
-   The frontend still displays an Avant/Après comparison, indicating a potential deeper caching problem or an unlocated piece of rendering logic.
-   The panel perspective and positioning, though significantly improved, are still not perfectly aligning with the user's expectations or the provided reference images, especially concerning inclination and avoiding overflow.
The current work is stalled at this point, with the user expressing frustration and requesting to resume the next day.

<optional_next_step>
I will re-examine the entire frontend codebase to definitively locate and resolve the persistent Avant/Après display, and then refine the panel rendering algorithm for perfect 3D inclination and positioning.
