The previous AI engineer focused on the critical task of virtually placing solar panels on roof images for the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. The core challenge involved generating realistic, perspective-corrected overlays that intelligently avoided obstacles and conformed to roof inclination. Despite repeated attempts and 100% solved declarations based on internal tests, the system consistently failed with real-world user-provided photos, leading to user frustration and wasted credits. The engineer iteratively refined the image processing pipeline in  using Pillow and scipy, shifting from complex AI-driven analysis to more localized geometric calculations. The trajectory reveals a pattern of over-optimistic self-assessment followed by immediate user feedback exposing persistent flaws. The latest major shift in strategy, prompted by user frustration, is to implement a frontend click system for the user to manually define the roof area, acknowledging the backend's inability to reliably detect it. The engineer is currently in the process of implementing this frontend solution, having encountered and attempting to fix a syntax error in .

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application aims to be a comprehensive solar calculation tool for France and Martinique, delivering financial projections and automated PDF quotes. Core requirements include enhanced PDF generation (FRH logo, correct footer, specific text colors, precise TVA calculation for France/Martinique), dynamic frontend visuals (green background, animated effects), and a robust success screen. The key feature under development is the Roof Analysis module at step 4/4, where users upload a roof photo. The system must analyze this image and automatically position 6, 12, or 18 solar panels (2.11m² each) virtually on the roof. This virtual placement requires realism, adherence to roof inclination, intelligent obstacle avoidance (Velux, chimneys), and distribution in separate roof zones. The challenge has been achieving this panel placement accurately and reliably on real-world photos, leading to a shift from AI-driven detection to a user-defined click-to-define-roof-area approach due to previous failures.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was grappling with the persistent failure of the automated solar panel placement on user-provided roof images. Despite numerous backend () refinements to  (e.g., drawing parallelograms, adding shadows, and simplifying grid positioning by replacing complex AI-driven functions with ), panels were still being placed off the actual roof area or failing to follow its inclination in real photos. The user expressed extreme frustration (de pire en pire, catastrophique, gaspillant de crédit).

In response to this, the AI engineer proposed a fundamental shift: instead of attempting to automatically detect the roof area, the system would allow the user to define it interactively. The user explicitly agreed, requesting a système de clic pour déterminer la zone du toit.

The AI engineer's current work is focused on implementing this click-to-define-roof-area system in the frontend, specifically in . The last few messages show the engineer attempting to add necessary state variables () and logic for this interactive feature within the  component. The immediate challenge is a persistent ESLint parsing error (Unexpected token ) that occurred after attempting to write to  in messages 86 and 100, which the engineer is currently trying to debug and resolve by reviewing existing state variable definitions and planning a step-by-step simplification of the click system implementation. The system is in a state where a critical new frontend feature is being introduced to overcome a persistent backend deficiency, and the engineer is troubleshooting the initial implementation steps.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue implementing the click system for defining the roof area on the frontend, specifically by resolving the existing ESLint syntax errors in  and correctly adding the necessary state variables and event handlers.
