The previous AI engineer successfully implemented and refined the optional battery storage feature for the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. Initially, the focus was on core functionality: solar kit calculation, financing logic, and a dynamic CSS 3D animation. The battery feature added a 5000€ cost and visual integration. This trajectory specifically details a comprehensive debugging and refinement phase for the battery feature's frontend display. Key issues addressed included incorrect price display in  (fixed by consistently using ), initial battery image sizing in , and iterative UI adjustments based on user feedback. These adjustments involved precisely repositioning text elements, meticulously resizing the battery image to match other elements (Linky, phone), fine-tuning their alignment, repositioning the 85% charged indicator, and adding a new explanatory text badge for battery usage. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic approach, using  for documentation and  for visual verification, ensuring all user interface requirements were met and verified.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application serves clients in France and Martinique, providing solar calculation and quote generation. It features dynamic CSS 3D solar animations, Martinique-specific pricing (TTC, TVA, interest), and offers solar kits from 12kW to 27kW, complemented by governmental aids and a three-tier discount system. While initial emphasis was on photorealistic panel superimposition (later pivoted to local OpenCV/PIL), the focus shifted to the existing CSS animation, requiring its auto-display post-Carré VERT positif success screen after a 7-second delay. Financial logic was refined for better alignment with monthly savings, and an Économie column was added. The latest successfully implemented feature is an optional green Batterie button, which increases the kit price by 5000€ when selected and visually integrates a battery image within the CSS animation, positioned between solar panels and the Linky meter, while preserving all existing functionalities.

-   ****: Main React component managing UI, state, user flow, kit selection, and calculation.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the application's user interface and interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Before this trajectory, introduced  state, , logic for +5000€ kit price adjustment if battery selected, sending  to backend. The primary fix in  section (prior to this trajectory) involved ensuring price display consistently used  for Investissement section. During this trajectory, minor adjustments related to test navigation were likely made (Chat Message 33).
-   ****: Defines global application styles.
    -   **Importance**: Provides base styling for the application's components.
    -   **Changes Made**: Styles for  and its selected state were added previously. No direct changes observed in this trajectory.
-   ****: React component rendering the dynamic 3D solar panel animation.
    -   **Importance**: Responsible for the visual presentation and structure of the CSS animation elements.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated a conditional  for the battery image (). During this trajectory, the AI engineer added the new  JSX element, conditionally rendered based on  prop (Chat Message 39).
-   ****: Styles for the CSS animation elements.
    -   **Importance**: Controls the visual presentation, positioning, and sizing of all elements within the solar animation.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file received extensive updates during the trajectory:
        *   Adjusted  or  properties for , , and  to shift them left (Chat Message 15-19).
        *   Modified dimensions (, ) for  and  to resize the battery image to match Linky/phone (Chat Message 21, 59).
        *   Adjusted  and  properties for , , and  for precise alignment and spacing (Chat Message 27, 29).
        *   Modified  property for the 85% chargée box (likely  or a similar class) to move it above the Linky (Chat Message 38, 58).
        *   Added new CSS rules for the  (Chat Message 42, 56) to position it, apply blue color, and handle its layout.
-   ****: Used for documenting testing, debugging, and communication.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes user problem statements, testing protocols, and logs of test results.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated throughout the trajectory to reflect implemented fixes and successful verifications of UI adjustments (Chat Messages 45, 47, 49, 51, 65, 66).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively involved in finalizing and debugging the optional battery storage feature as per user feedback. Before the recent trajectory, the backend () was confirmed to correctly process  and add 5000€ to . The primary focus was on frontend fixes in  to ensure the  and other key price displays consistently referenced  (including battery cost), resolving a prior bug where the 5000€ was not always shown. Initial adjustments to the battery image size in  were also made.

During the current trajectory, the work was exclusively on refining the animation's visual elements in response to detailed user feedback. This included:
1.  **Text Repositioning**: Shifting three key text lines (, , ) in  to the left to create space.
2.  **Battery Image Sizing & Alignment**: Iteratively resizing the battery image ( and  in ) to exactly match the Linky meter and phone's dimensions (final dimensions 190px x 360px) and precisely aligning all three elements (, , ) using  CSS properties for uniform spacing.
3.  **85% Charged Box Visibility**: Repositioning the 85% chargée indicator ( property in ) to ensure it's fully visible and positioned correctly above the battery and Linky (final ).
4.  **New Informative Text Badge**: Adding a new blue text badge () in  and styling it in  with the text Batterie de Stockage = Utilisation pour la Nuit : Climatisation , Lumière , TV , PC , chargeur , Frigo , etc.. and ensuring it displays conditionally when the battery is selected, and preventing overlap with existing badges.

All modifications were verified with screenshots and documented in . The AI engineer successfully concluded the requested UI refinements.
