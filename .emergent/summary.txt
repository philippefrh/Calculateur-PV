The task required summarizing the previous AI engineer's extensive work on the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application based on a provided trajectory. My approach involved a detailed chronological analysis of each message to capture user requests, the AI engineer's responses, key technical decisions, and specific code modifications. I identified two primary feature developments: creating a new 20-year financial projection visual and, more significantly, the highly iterative and challenging task of precisely replicating a PDF report (SYRIUS template) with France Renov Martinique branding. The PDF replication involved persistent debugging of layout, image placement, text alignment, and data integration across numerous user feedback cycles. Frontend UI refinements like duplicating a green status box and extending a countdown timer were also documented. This thorough review ensured all technical details and the current state of the application were accurately captured, which is crucial for seamless handover.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation quote generator for clients in France and Martinique. It features dynamic CSS 3D solar animations and supports region-specific pricing, 12-27kW kit selections, government aids, and discounts. A core requirement was a visual amortization table matching legacy software, integrated into the Analyse financi√®re tab, requiring calculations for R√©cup√©ration de votre subvention, √âconomies r√©alis√©es, Total, Reste √† financer, Nouvelle mensualit√©, Mensualit√© initiale, and Revente de surplus. UI refinements included bolded text, specific blue/green colors, precise arrows, removal of strikethrough prices, and a green Reste √† financer display. A Ballon solaire option was added. Recent key requests involved adding a new 20-year financial projection visual, pixel-perfectly replicating a provided image with specific calculations (e.g., 5% annual increase). A major, iterative task was creating a branded PDF (France Renov Martinique) that exactly duplicates a SYRIUS template, including dynamic client data, specific image, logos, and intricate layout details. Frontend UI updates included duplicating a green POSITIF box and extending a countdown timer.

It also dynamically integrates client data (name, address) into an orange-background box (8cm x 4cm, 14pt font, bolded). The main text (Madame / Monsieur...) was adjusted to be justified, 7 lines long (with a blank line added), 13pt font, and stretched across almost the entire page width (18cm, with 1cm margins). The FRH footer was positioned at the bottom on 2 lines.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was primarily focused on achieving pixel-perfect replication of the SYRIUS PDF template for France Renov Martinique and on making minor UI/timing adjustments in the frontend.

**Key work streams and their current state:**
1.  **SYRIUS PDF Replication**: This was the most iterative and challenging task. The engineer was consistently working to match the provided SYRIUS PDF format exactly. This involved:
    *   Replacing company details with France Renov Martinique (logo, name, address, phone, email, etc.).
    *   Integrating dynamic client data (name, address) into an orange-background box.
    *   Implementing a Martinique roof background image that fills the entire page without white borders.
    *   Meticulously positioning and styling all elements (FRH logo, client details box, main text, footer) to match the original SYRIUS layout, including exact margins, column/row widths, and text alignment ().
    *   Ensuring the main body text is precisely 7 lines (after initial adjustments) and extends to almost the full page width.
    *   Consolidating the PDF to a single page and ensuring the FRH footer remains at the very bottom of that single page.
    *   Ensuring the white and orange header squares have identical dimensions (8cm x 4cm) and are perfectly centered side-by-side. The font size in the orange box was iteratively increased to 14pt.
    *   **Current status**: The PDF generation is functional, and the last iterations aimed to correct text wrapping/width (using  alignment and 13pt font, after trying larger fonts), reposition elements (like the FRH footer to stay on page 1), and align the two header squares perfectly. The user frequently provided very specific feedback on these visual aspects, indicating that the task is largely complete but still under strict visual scrutiny.

2.  **20-Year Financial Projection Visual**: A new visual table was added to , positioned below the amortization table. It incorporates new calculations, including a 20-year projection with a 5% annual increase. This functionality was implemented and the backend successfully tested.

3.  **Frontend Error Resolution**: Critical  errors, which occurred when attempting to format  values, were identified and resolved in  by implementing defensive programming (e.g., ).

4.  **Green Autonomy Box Duplication**: The POSITIF green autonomy box on the frontend web page was successfully duplicated. There is now an identical box on the right side of the screen, mirroring the existing one on the left. Minor vertical alignment corrections were made to ensure they are at the exact same height.

5.  **Countdown Timer Extension**: The automatic transition timer from the Calcul termin√© avec succ√®s! screen to the CSS animation was extended in  from 7 seconds to 15 seconds. This provides users with more time to review initial results.

The last interaction from the user indicated they were concluding the session for the day after the countdown timer adjustment was confirmed.
