The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned from enhancing the  page, which involved integrating visual elements like sun, Linky meter, phone, and animated banknotes (with the eventual removal of a problematic power cable), to directly addressing core business logic updates. The immediate shift in focus was prompted by a user request to update Martinique's solar panel kit pricing and associated parameters. The engineer systematically analyzed existing configurations, implemented new price points, added new kit sizes, adjusted aid amounts, updated the interest rate, and critically, corrected the panel wattage from 500W to 375W across backend calculations and PDF specifications. A key challenge arose when the frontend displayed outdated panel counts despite backend updates. This required a targeted fix to ensure the backend API returned the correct  count and the frontend consumed this data directly, rather than recalculating it with an outdated formula, ensuring data consistency across the application.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. The initial build focused on PDF enhancements, UI consistency, and a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation was enhanced to include an animated sun, a real-time kWh Linky meter, a persistent mobile phone display with synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh values, and an animated sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text followed by stacking banknotes. Specific visual requirements included repositioning the phone (right: 80px) and Linky meter (left: 30%) for central banknote space, resizing the Linky to match the phone (200x400px), ensuring no panel overlap, and styling new Autoconsommation = Économies and existing Installation terminée ! badges with green background and white text. The problematic power cable was ultimately removed.

Following this, the user requested an update to the Martinique panel pack pricing: a new list of TTC prices, a confirmed TVA of 2.10%, and a recalculation of the credit interest rate from 8% to 8.63%. This involved updating existing kit prices (3kW, 6kW, 9kW), adding 6 new kits (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW) with their corresponding prices and aid amounts, and adjusting the calculation based on a panel power of 375W (instead of 500W), which impacts the number of panels per kit and derived surface areas.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a series of comprehensive enhancements to the  page, integrating dynamic elements like an animated sun, a real-time Linky meter with flowing kWh particles, a persistently visible mobile phone displaying synchronized production/consumption, and an animated sequence of stacking banknotes illustrating financial savings. The latest visual refinements involved repositioning the phone (), resizing and repositioning the Linky meter (, 200x400px) to match the phone and create space for banknotes, implementing a new Autoconsommation = Économies badge, displaying distinct euro banknotes with realistic animations, and restyling both the new and existing Installation terminée ! badges with a green background and white text. The power cable feature was ultimately abandoned.

Following the visual enhancements, the focus shifted to updating core business logic for the Martinique region. The AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Updated Martinique Kit Data**: Implemented new TTC prices and aid amounts for existing 3kW, 6kW, and 9kW kits.
2.  **Added New Kits**: Introduced 6 new kit sizes (12kW, 15kW, 18kW, 21kW, 24kW, 27kW) with their specified prices and aid amounts.
3.  **Adjusted Interest Rate**: Changed the financing interest rate for Martinique to 8.63% from 8%.
4.  **Updated Panel Wattage**: Changed the standard panel power from 500W to 375W, recalculating the number of panels required for each kit (e.g., 3kW now uses 8 panels, 6kW uses 16 panels) and updating technical specifications for PDF generation.

After successful backend testing, a critical UI discrepancy was identified: the frontend was still displaying incorrect panel counts despite the backend updates. This was traced to two issues:
1.  The  endpoint in  was not returning the  field. This was rectified by explicitly including  in the API response.
2.  The  component in the frontend was hardcoding the panel calculation (e.g., ) instead of using the  data provided by the API. This was corrected by modifying  to directly use the  property from the API response.

The application currently has all Martinique kit pricing, aid amounts, interest rates, and panel calculations updated and correctly reflected in the backend API. The frontend has been patched to display the accurate number of panels based on the updated 375W panel power and the new API data.
