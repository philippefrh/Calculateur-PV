The previous AI engineer focused on developing the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from its inception, primarily on an AI-driven solar panel placement feature and a 3D animation of solar installations. The roof analysis feature, despite extensive iterations and attempts using OpenAI Vision and then Pillow, was ultimately abandoned due to persistent failures in accurately interpreting roof images and avoiding obstacles. This led to a pivot towards a visually appealing 3D animation. The initial Three.js attempt also failed, leading to a successful implementation using CSS-based animations. Recently, the focus has shifted to stabilizing the application's frontend. The AI engineer successfully resolved critical JavaScript runtime errors, including a component naming typo ( vs ), a null-check issue in , and a crucial bug where calculation results were not being passed from the  component to the main  component, causing an infinite loading state. The application is now reported as stable and functional, allowing users to proceed through the calculation flow to the results page.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application aims to be a comprehensive solar calculation tool for France and Martinique, generating financial projections and automated PDF quotes in Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial requirements included PDF enhancements (FRH logo, correct footer, specific text colors, TVA calculation for France 20% and Martinique 2.1%), frontend visual improvements (solid green background with animations), extended success screen duration (20 seconds), and UI consistency for logos. A key requested feature, Roof Analysis, involved AI-driven virtual placement of solar panels (6, 12, or 18 panels, 2.11m² each) on an uploaded roof image, respecting inclination and avoiding obstacles. This feature was abandoned due to persistent issues. The focus then shifted to a dynamic, animated visual representation of the solar installation, triggered automatically after a 20-second success screen. This animation should display panels, an inverter (later removed), and a mobile application, with configurable panel counts, and navigate back to the financial summary page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the integration and refinement of a CSS-based 3D animation feature into the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application and significantly improved the application's stability by resolving critical frontend runtime errors.

The work involved:
1.  **Removal of problematic Roof Analysis feature**: The entire backend and frontend logic related to uploading roof photos and placing panels was completely removed to restore stability (Chat 124-133).
2.  **Successful 3D Animation Implementation**: After abandoning a Three.js attempt, a CSS-based animation (, ) was successfully integrated into  (Chat 136-209). This animation now dynamically displays the correct number of panels and has removed the inverter, enlarging and repositioning the mobile application display (Chat 224-255).
3.  **Adjusted Application Flow**: The animation automatically triggers after the 20-second success screen. Navigation buttons within the animation (, , ) correctly direct the user (Chat 269-309).
4.  **Critical Frontend Bug Fixes (Most Recent)**:
    *   **Component Naming Typo**: Resolved a  by correcting a typo in  where  was referenced instead of the existing  component (Chat 5-13, 22-25).
    *   **Prop Mismatch**: Adjusted the props passed to  to ensure only the expected ones (, , , ) were provided, resolving related  errors (Chat 22-25).
    *   **Null Check in **: Added a null-check for the  object within the  function to prevent  when  is not yet available (Chat 30-35).
    *   ** Rendering Protection**: Implemented a conditional render at the beginning of  to display a Loading results... message if  is null, preventing errors due to premature data access (Chat 38-43).
    *   **Calculation Results Flow Fix**: The most critical recent fix involved identifying and resolving an issue where the  component was not correctly passing its  state to the  parent component. This led to  holding a null , causing the  to perpetually display Chargement des résultats... (loading results). The  function in  was modified to call the  prop with the final , ensuring the parent  component's state is updated correctly (Chat 49-73).

The current state is that the core solar calculation application is stable, the CSS animation is fully integrated and functional with specified content and flow, and the navigation works correctly. The user can now complete the calculation process and view results without encountering runtime errors or infinite loading states.
