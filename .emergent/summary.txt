The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from initial PDF and frontend styling fixes to integrating a new, complex AI-powered feature. The early phase focused on critical bug resolutions like a persistent  conflict in  affecting the success screen duration and precise CSS adjustments for visual consistency (background, logo sizes, success screen). The most recent development involved a detailed collaboration with the user to integrate OpenAI Vision API for automated solar panel placement on roof images. This required guiding the user through OpenAI account creation and API key retrieval, followed by backend endpoint creation using  and corresponding frontend UI modifications. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills in identifying and resolving the  import error, ensuring the backend API is functional for image analysis.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation tool for France and Martinique, designed to offer accurate financial projections, automate PDF quotes, and adapt to regional specifics. It supports Realistic and Optimistic modes and generates professional, branded PDF quotes with dynamic data.

User's explicit requests and issues addressed:
*   **PDF Enhancements**: Integrate FRH logo (top-left, bottom-right), correct footer address, fix délai de livraison and offre valable text colors (green text, black values), revert TVA calculation (20% France, 2.1% Martinique).
*   **Frontend Visuals**: Change background to solid green (), add dynamic animated effects (floating particles, luminous ripples) with adjustable intensity.
*   **Success Screen**: Extend display duration to 20 seconds, enlarge central visual, update phrase to Ce % déconomie **et dautonomie** de couleur verte....
*   **UI Consistency**: Standardize height of Étude 1 and Étude 2 logos to match France - Martinique logos (74px).
*   **New Feature (Roof Analysis)**: At step 4/4, add a Insérer photos de la toiture button. Upon photo upload, use AI (OpenAI Vision) to automatically calculate and virtually position 6, 12, or 18 solar panels (each 2.11m²) on the uploaded roof image, ensuring a realistic final render. The user explicitly chose the Complete AI version despite the per-analysis cost (0.01-0.05€).

The application uses a standard full-stack setup:


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  to securely store the provided OpenAI API key for AI integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages backend API routes, database interaction, external service calls (PVGIS), financial calculations, and PDF generation.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   Fixed  for délai de livraison and offre valable jusquau" text colors, integrated FRH logo (top-left, bottom-right), corrected footer address, reverted TVA calculation.
        *   Added a new FastAPI endpoint (`/api/analyze-roof`) for AI-powered roof analysis. This endpoint receives an image (base64) and panel count, calls `emergentintegrations.llm.LlmChat` with `gpt-4o` to analyze the roof and generate panel placements, and returns a base64 encoded image.
        *   Corrected the `LLMChat` import to `LlmChat` (lowercase l) to resolve an `ImportError`.
        *   Added necessary imports for `FileContent`, `UploadFile`, `Request`, `Form`, and `base64`.

-   **`/app/backend/requirements.txt`**:
    -   **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added `emergentintegrations` to enable OpenAI Vision API calls.

-   **`/app/frontend/src/App.js`**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component controlling UI flow, form data, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   Resolved a demo mode error with `formData.monthlyEdfPayment`.
        *   Added `div` elements for background animations.
        *   Refined success screen logic: fixed 20-second display duration by removing a conflicting 2-second `setTimeout` in `performCalculation` (line 2145), and added "et dautonomie to the success phrase.  was implemented for  to prevent timer re-creation.
        *   Adjusted  for horizontal buttons.
        *   **New Feature**: Added  hooks (, , , ) to manage the image upload and analysis state.
        *   Added  and  functions to process image files, encode them to base64, send to the new backend  endpoint, and update the UI with results.
        *   Modified the  component's props to include , , , , , and  to integrate the new UI elements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the new Insérer photos de la toiture feature, which involves AI-powered solar panel placement on roof images.

The core steps completed were:
1.  **OpenAI API Key Acquisition**: Guided the user to create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key, which was then securely added to the  file.
2.  **Backend Integration**:
    *   Installed the  library in .
    *   Created a new FastAPI endpoint () in . This endpoint is designed to accept an image (base64 encoded) and the number of panels, use the OpenAI Vision API (specifically  via ) to analyze the roof, determine optimal panel placement, and return a base64 encoded image with panels superimposed.
    *   Resolved a critical  by correcting the case of  to  in .
3.  **Frontend Integration**:
    *   Modified  to include new React  variables to manage the upload process (, , , ).
    *   Added  and  functions to handle client-side image processing (base64 encoding) and API calls to the new backend endpoint.
    *   Updated the  component's props and its usage in  to pass these new state variables and functions, allowing the new UI elements to interact with the backend logic.
    *   Added new CSS rules to  to style the roof analysis section, including containers, image display, and controls, ensuring a visually appealing interface.

The last action performed was fixing the  import error in the backend and restarting the backend service to apply the fix. The backend service is currently running, and the next step is to test the newly implemented backend endpoint.
