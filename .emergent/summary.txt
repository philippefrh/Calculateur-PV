The AI engineer successfully enhanced the solar calculation application, integrating numerous user requirements. Initially, the focus was on adapting the app for the Martinique region, which involved gathering specific financial parameters (kits, aids, interest rates) and implementing a robust region-switching system (France/Martinique). This led to significant backend modifications for dynamic calculations and frontend UI adjustments for a seamless user experience, including dynamic logo and address display. A key challenge, CSS centering of dynamic text, was efficiently resolved with the help of a troubleshooter. Subsequently, the engineer synchronized financing durations for better comparison and, most notably, implemented a novel financing logic proposed by the user: a fixed positive cash flow (monthly savings minus 25€) by dynamically adjusting the loan duration. The final major task involved precisely replicating a detailed visual vignette in the UI, dynamically populating it with the new calculated data, and meticulously refining its styling and spacing. Throughout this trajectory, the engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving, adaptability to evolving user requests, and effective use of testing and debugging tools.

<product_requirements>
The user, managing FRH ENVIRONNEMENT, aimed to evolve a React/FastAPI/MongoDB solar calculation MVP into a professional tool, primarily for two regions: France and Martinique. The core problem involved precise financial calculations for solar installations, including various aid structures, interest rates, and projected savings, presented clearly to the client.

Key product requirements and their current implementation status:
1.  **Regional Adaptation (Martinique)**: Implement specific kits (3kW, 6kW, 9kW), associated aid amounts (€5,340, €6,480, €9,720 respectively), an 8% interest rate (standard and aided), and utilize PVGIS for regional solar production, with all prices being TTC (no TVA recovery). This has been fully implemented in the backend and integrated into the frontend.
2.  **Unified Application with Region Switching**: Integrate both France and Martinique versions into a single application with a seamless UI selector, rather than separate deployments. This includes dynamic display of regional logos and addresses. This functionality is fully implemented.
3.  **Enhanced Financial Calculation & Presentation**:
    *   **Synchronization of Financing Durations**: Ensure Financement standard and Financement optimisé are presented over the same duration for direct comparison. Implemented.
    *   **Optimized Financing Model**: Implement a new business logic where the optimized financing monthly payment is always , dynamically calculating the loan duration required for this fixed positive cash-flow. This revolutionary calculation is fully implemented in the backend.
    *   **Visual Vignette**: Replicate a specific, detailed 4x2 grid financial summary vignette from a provided design, dynamically populating it with application data. This visual element has been meticulously implemented and styled to match the exact design, including spacing.
4.  **UI/Functionality Fixes**:
    *   Ensure Modifier les données button correctly navigates back from results screen. Fixed.
    *   Correctly display panel count in UI vignettes and technical specifications for Martinique kits. Fixed.
    *   Ensure PDF generation uses correct regional data (e.g., Martinique data for Martinique PDF). Fixed.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a highly requested visual vignette and refined its styling to perfectly match a user-provided design.

**Current State of the Product (Visuals & Calculations):**
*   **Regional System**: The application now seamlessly switches between France and Martinique versions via a top-right selector.
*   **Dynamic Identity**: The logo (now including Région Martinique text, precisely centered and styled) and company address (France or Fort-de-France) dynamically update based on the selected region.
*   **Martinique Parameters**:
    *   Kits: 3kW (€9,900), 6kW (€13,900), 9kW (€16,900) TTC with specific aids.
    *   Interest Rate: 8% TAEG.
*   **Optimized Financing Model**: This is a major new feature. The calculation now guarantees a positive cash-flow for the client. Instead of a fixed loan duration, the monthly payment for the optimized financing is set to , and the loan duration is dynamically calculated to achieve this. For instance, with a 6kW kit in Martinique, a monthly saving of €216.14 results in an optimized monthly payment of €191.40, reducing the loan duration from 7 years to 3.8 years and providing a guaranteed +€24.74/month cash flow.
*   **Synchronized Financing Durations**: Both Financement standard and Financement optimisé now display the same calculated duration for comparison, making the financial benefit of aids clear.
*   **Accurate Panel Count & PDF**: Panel counts are now correctly calculated and displayed for Martinique kits, and PDF generation correctly uses region-specific data.
*   **Modifier les données Button**: This button on the results screen now correctly navigates back to the calculation form.
*   **New Visual Vignette**: A prominent 4x2 grid vignette has been integrated into the results screen. It dynamically displays key financial and technical data (Project Cost, KAP, Aids, Real Cost, Production, Amortization Duration, Savings %, Monthly Savings).

**Work Done & Nuances (Most Recent):**
The last sequence of work focused on creating and perfecting the new visual vignette. This involved:
1.  **Code Integration ()**: Replacing an existing overview section with a new  component, which pulls data dynamically from the calculated results (e.g., , , ).
2.  **Detailed Styling ()**: Implementing comprehensive CSS rules to precisely match the user's reference image for the vignette. This included:
    *   Defining a  layout for the main container () with  to create the 4-column structure.
    *   Applying specific background colors ( for general background,  for green highlight cells) and text colors.
    *   Adding  to the grid container and  to its children () to create the requested spacing between cells.
    *   Applying  to individual cells for a consistent look.
    *   Ensuring content is centered within each cell using , , , .
    *   The styling for the vignette's spacing was fine-tuned in the very last messages to achieve an exact match to the user's visual expectation.
