The AI engineer successfully diagnosed and resolved a critical flow issue in the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. The user reported that the Calcul terminé avec succès screen was displaying for only 4 seconds instead of the intended 20, and the subsequent 3D solar panel animation was being skipped, directly leading to the financial analysis page. The engineer meticulously investigated the  component, utilizing  and a  agent to reproduce and confirm the bug. The root cause was identified as a conflicting 1-second  within the  function, which prematurely advanced the application flow, overriding the intended 20-second success screen timer and bypassing the animation. The fix involved modifying this function in  to eliminate the premature redirection. Post-fix, verification via  and  agent confirmed that the application now correctly displays the success screen for 20 seconds, followed by the CSS animation, before proceeding to the results page, thus stabilizing the core user journey.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is designed as a comprehensive solar calculation tool for France and Martinique, providing financial projections and automated PDF quotes in Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial requirements included specific PDF enhancements (FRH logo, correct footer, text colors, TVA calculation for France 20% and Martinique 2.1%), frontend visual improvements (solid green background with animations), and UI consistency for logos. A key feature, Roof Analysis (AI-driven virtual placement of solar panels on uploaded roof images), was abandoned due to persistent technical issues. The focus shifted to a dynamic, animated visual representation of the solar installation (), triggered automatically after a 20-second success screen. This animation should display panels and a mobile application, with configurable panel counts, and navigate back to the financial summary page. The most recent user feedback highlighted an issue where the Calcul terminé avec succès screen displayed for only 4 seconds, and the 3D animation failed to appear, leading directly to the financial analysis page.

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB.
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab for quote generation.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Vision API (initially explored, then abandoned for roof analysis).
- **Image Processing**: PIL/Pillow and  (for abandoned roof analysis).
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js (attempted and abandoned for animation).
- **Web Animation**: CSS animations (successfully implemented).

The application uses a standard full-stack setup:


- ****:
    - **Summary**: Stores environment variables like , , , .
    - **Changes Made**:  added, then deprecated for image analysis.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Handles API routes, AI analysis, and image processing.
    - **Changes Made**: The  endpoint and related image processing functions (, , ) were completely removed as the roof analysis feature was abandoned.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Python dependencies.
    - **Changes Made**: , , and  were added for roof analysis and remain, though no longer strictly required.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Frontend environment variables;  is used for API calls.
    - **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API interactions. It handles multi-step form navigation, integrates animations, and manages the overall application flow.
    - **Changes Made**: Extensive modifications. Initially included roof analysis UI/logic (later removed). Integrated  (later replaced), then  at . Success screen timer logic modified to auto-transition. Button logic within  was linked to navigation. Most recently, critical fixes include: Correcting  to ; adjusting props passed to ; adding null-check  in ; implementing an early return/loading state in  for null ; and crucially, modifying  in  to call  to pass data to  to resolve infinite loading. Latest change involved removing a premature 1-second  within  (lines 2459-2461) to ensure the 20-second success screen and subsequent CSS animation play correctly before transitioning to the results.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Application styling.
    - **Changes Made**: Updated background, success screen, and roof analysis styles (later removed).

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Created for Three.js 3D animation.
    - **Changes Made**: Contained complex Three.js setup. Abandoned and replaced by CSS animation.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Created for the successful CSS-based 3D-like animation.
    - **Changes Made**: Contains React component logic for animated solar panels and mobile app. Modified to remove inverter, enlarge mobile app, position elements, and handle dynamic .

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Styling for the CSS-based animation.
    - **Changes Made**: Contains all CSS for 3D transformations, animations, and positioning.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Documentation for testing, problem statements, and communication logs.
    - **Changes Made**: Regularly updated to log changes, user feedback, and internal communication, including the recent fix for the success screen timer and animation flow.

<pending_tasks>
- **Deferred Feature**: Implement dual application versions for Particuliers (Individuals) and Professionnels (Professionals).
- **Quote Integration - Remaining Pages**: Integrate the remaining 3 pages of the quote PDF (awaiting user provision).
- **Abandoned Feature**: The Roof Analysis feature (AI-driven panel placement on uploaded photos) was completely removed due to persistent issues.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer addressed a critical application flow issue reported by the user. The user observed that the Calcul terminé avec succès screen appeared for only 4 seconds instead of the expected 20, and the subsequent 3D solar panel animation was completely skipped, leading directly to the financial analysis page.

The work involved:
1.  **Problem Diagnosis**: The AI engineer investigated  and identified that the  function contained a  of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) that prematurely called . This action was overriding the intended 20-second display duration for the success screen and preventing the  (which should appear at ) from rendering.
2.  **Code Modification**: The  that redirected the flow in  was removed or commented out. This change ensures that the  component's internal timer correctly manages the 20-second display of the success screen and then transitions to the  as intended.
3.  **Verification**: The fix was confirmed through screenshots and repeated testing via the frontend testing agent, which validated that the success screen now correctly displays for 20 seconds, followed by the  (step 6), and then the financial analysis page (step 7).

The application's core calculation flow is now stable, the 20-second success screen functions as specified, and the CSS animation sequence plays correctly, resolving the user's reported regression.
