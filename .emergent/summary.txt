The previous AI engineer successfully extended the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from visual enhancements to critical business logic. Initially, the focus was on refining the  with dynamic elements and visual consistency, including sun, Linky meter, phone, and animated banknotes. Subsequently, the engineer addressed a major user request to update Martinique's solar panel kit pricing, adding new kit sizes, adjusting aid amounts, changing the interest rate, and correcting panel wattage from 500W to 375W. A key challenge involved ensuring frontend data consistency by explicitly returning  from the backend API and updating the frontend to consume this data directly. Most recently, the engineer implemented a new R discount button feature, allowing a €1000 reduction per kit, with visual feedback and proper integration into backend calculations, without appearing on the final quote, as requested by the user. The backend functionality for this discount was confirmed, and the engineer is now awaiting user verification for the frontend.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. The initial development focused on PDF enhancements, UI consistency, and a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation featured an animated sun, a real-time kWh Linky meter, a persistent mobile phone with synchronized kWh values (green for production, red for consumption), and an animated sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies text followed by stacking euro banknotes. Specific visual requirements included repositioning the phone (right: 80px), Linky meter (left: 30%, 200x400px), ensuring no panel overlap, and styling Autoconsommation = Économies and Installation terminée ! badges with a green background and white text. A problematic power cable was removed.

Subsequently, the user requested updates to Martinique panel pack pricing: a new list of TTC prices, a confirmed TVA of 2.10%, and a recalculation of the credit interest rate from 8% to 8.63%. This involved updating existing kits (3kW, 6kW, 9kW), adding 6 new kits (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW) with corresponding prices and aid amounts, and adjusting calculations based on a panel power of 375W (instead of 500W). The latest requirement added a discrete R button on each kit selection card to apply a €1000 discount, which should reflect in subsequent calculations but not appear on the final quote.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a new discount functionality requested by the user. This involved adding a discrete R button (20px x 20px, red, low opacity) to each solar kit card on the frontend ( and ). Clicking this button applies a 1000€ reduction to the selected kit's price. The frontend visually represents this by displaying the original price struck through, alongside the new, reduced price in red for TTC and green for aided prices.

On the backend (), the  function was updated to accept and incorporate this discount amount into all subsequent financial calculations, ensuring that monthly payments reflect the reduction. The implementation ensures that the discount is managed per kit using React's state, is compatible across both France and Martinique regions, and is correctly reset when the user changes or resets their kit selection. Crucially, as per user's explicit request, this discount is *not* reflected in the final quote PDF.

Backend tests using  confirmed that the discount functionality works perfectly for all 9 Martinique kits, with calculations for financing correctly integrating the reduction, leading to significantly reduced monthly payments. The application is now in a state where the discount feature is fully integrated and validated on the backend. The engineer has completed the implementation and is awaiting user confirmation on the frontend display and functionality.
