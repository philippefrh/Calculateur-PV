The AI engineer's primary focus was to debug and fix critical issues within the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, specifically concerning the R1/R2/R3 discount system. This involved addressing inaccurate discount applications in final calculations, incorrect kit selections, and a broken confirmation modal. The PDF generation feature was explicitly deprioritized due to persistent fidelity challenges. The engineer systematically analyzed both the React frontend () and FastAPI backend (), tracing data flow for  and . Key resolutions included ensuring consistent data passing between components, making the entire kit card clickable for intuitive selection, and correcting the display logic in the financial summary to utilize  from the backend. Backend tests confirmed correct discount application and data return. The mission successfully concluded with the discount system fully operational and accurately reflected across the application. Subsequently, the user requested a new feature for realistic solar panel placement on client house photos.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application functions as a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique. Initial requirements included a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation () featuring elements like an animated sun, Linky meter, persistent phone, kWh values, euro banknotes, and an Autoconsommation = Économies badge, with a panel wattage of 375W. Martinique-specific pricing required updates: new TTC prices, 2.10% TVA, 8.63% interest rate, and expansion to include 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW kits with corresponding prices and aid amounts. A crucial feature was the implementation of three mutually exclusive discount buttons (R1: €1000, R2: €2000, R3: €3000) that apply to calculations but are hidden from the final quote. A significant, currently pending requirement involved integrating dynamic PDF quote generation by transforming an existing Syrius Martinique PDF to FRH Martinique and injecting dynamic client and calculation data into specific pages.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the primary task of fixing the R1/R2/R3 discount functionality. The application's state before the fix was characterized by several critical issues: discounts were visually displayed on the kit cards but not correctly applied in the final financial calculations, selecting a kit with a discount could result in an incorrect kit power being used for calculation (e.g., 6kW becoming 9kW), and the confirmation modal after kit selection was broken, preventing users from proceeding.

The AI engineer addressed these by:
1.  **Frontend Fixes ():**
    *   Ensuring that  and  were correctly passed to the backend API in the  call.
    *   Repairing the confirmation modal by modifying the  handler of the kit cards to ensure that  was consistently set when any part of the card was clicked, not just the discount buttons.
    *   Correcting the display logic in the Analyse Financière (Financial Analysis) tab and other financing sections to correctly use  (the price after discount) instead of  (the original price) for displaying the final investment and loan details.
2.  **Backend Fixes ():**
    *   A critical issue related to accessing keys within the  dictionary (line 671) was identified and fixed, which was preventing correct kit pricing retrieval.
    *   Backend tests () confirmed that the  endpoint was correctly receiving  and , and was returning the expected , , and  values for both France and Martinique regions.

The application is now fully functional regarding the R1/R2/R3 discount system: discounts are applied, calculations are accurate, and prices are correctly displayed across all relevant sections, including the financial analysis. The confirmation flow is also restored.
