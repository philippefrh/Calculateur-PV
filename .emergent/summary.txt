The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a series of complex bug fixes and minor feature enhancements for the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. Initially, the engineer fixed a critical timing issue in  where the Calcul terminé avec succès screen prematurely advanced, skipping the 20-second display and a crucial 3D animation. The trajectory shows a strong iterative development approach, where user feedback directly drove subsequent bug resolutions. Key issues addressed included malfunctioning navigation buttons (e.g., Modifier les données, Retour aux Résultats), a backend geocoding service timeout requiring a fallback mechanism, and a critical financial calculation inconsistency stemming from the backend not receiving manual kit selections. The engineer also fixed a region-specific kit lookup error in the backend and refined UI synchronization. Each problem was diagnosed by inspecting relevant frontend (React , ) and backend (FastAPI ) files, followed by targeted code modifications and verification steps using  and  agents. The work culminated in ensuring display and calculation coherence across various user interactions and regions.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application aims to be a comprehensive solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, offering Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial requirements included specific PDF enhancements (FRH logo, correct footer, text/TVA), solid green background with animations, and UI consistency. An AI-driven Roof Analysis feature was abandoned due to technical issues, shifting focus to a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation should auto-trigger after a 20-second Calcul terminé avec succès screen, display configurable panels/mobile app, and navigate to the financial summary.

Recent user feedback highlighted:
1.  Calcul terminé avec succès screen displayed for only 4 seconds instead of 20, skipping the 3D animation. (Resolved by previous engineer)
2.  Modifier les données and Retour aux résultats buttons not navigating correctly.
3.  Erreur lors du calcul due to geocoding timeouts.
4.  Financial calculations not updating correctly after manual kit selection (e.g., 3kW vs 6kW), despite display being fixed.
5.  Backend calculation error for Martinique kits due to key mismatch.
6.  Retour aux Résultats button within the  component not functioning.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer addressed a series of critical issues to ensure the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application's stability and data consistency. The primary focus evolved from initial flow fixes to addressing complex navigation bugs and data synchronization problems.

The key issues and solutions were:
1.  **Navigation Button Malfunctions**: The Modifier les données and Retour aux Résultats buttons were not navigating as expected. This was fixed by aligning 's  and button  handlers with the application's multi-step flow, ensuring  uses correct states ('results' or dynamically calculated previous steps). A new Voir toutes les options de financement button was also added to enhance navigation to the financial summary.
2.  **Geocoding Service Failure**: The application experienced Erreur lors du calcul due to timeouts from the  geocoding service. The  backend was modified to include a fallback mechanism, providing default latitude/longitude for France and Martinique when geocoding fails, preventing calculation errors. A region detection function was also added to assist this.
3.  **Financial Calculation Inconsistency**: Despite frontend display corrections, backend financial calculations remained based on the default kit even when a manual kit (e.g., 6kW instead of 3kW) was selected. This was a critical bug. The  endpoint in  was updated to accept  as a parameter. The backend's calculation logic was modified to use this  if provided, ensuring all financial projections align with the user's selected kit. The frontend's API call in  was updated to transmit this .
4.  **Region-Specific Kit Lookup Error**: A specific Calculation error: 3 occurred for Martinique, traced to a key mismatch where the backend expected kit_3kw but received 3. The  was updated to dynamically form the correct kit key based on the region.
5.  **Persistent Navigation Issue in Animation**: The Retour aux Résultats button within the  component continued to malfunction, using  instead of the intended  prop. This was corrected, ensuring proper navigation back to the results page.

The application is now reported as 100% functional, with coherent display, accurate financial calculations, and fully operational navigation across all steps and regions.
