The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, initially focusing on a progressive battery charge/discharge animation in  and . This involved refining visual elements and logic. A pivot occurred due to Erreur lors du chargement des kits and subsequent critical financial display bugs in . The engineer successfully resolved these by ensuring accurate calculation and display of Reste à financer, Investissement après aides, and Options de financement based on  and . The user confirmed these fixes. The most recent phase involved integrating an amortization table. After initially misinterpreting the visual design, the engineer corrected the HTML and CSS in  and  to precisely match the user's provided reference image, successfully achieving the desired visual layout. The next logical step is to implement the detailed calculations for this newly structured amortization table.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application aims to generate solar calculation quotes for clients in France and Martinique. Core features include dynamic CSS 3D solar animations, region-specific pricing (Martinique: TTC, TVA, interest), solar kit selection (12kW-27kW), government aids, and a three-tier discount system. A key display requirement is the automatic CSS animation post-Carré VERT positif after a 7-second delay. Financial logic previously incorporated monthly savings with an Économie column. Recently, an optional Batterie feature was added, incurring a 5000€ cost and integrating a battery image into the animation. The user requested enhancing this with a progressive charge/discharge animation (0-100% in 5% increments, then inverse, then loop) synchronized with panel production, ensuring the green percentage label moves correctly and the battery image is enlarged. Financial display inconsistencies related to the battery option (Reste à financer empty, Options de financement incorrect, Investissement après aides empty) were explicitly fixed. The current major request is to integrate an amortization table into the Analyse financière tab, visually mirroring an old software's design, and performing specific calculations based on existing app data (, , average monthly savings, etc.), including details like Récupération de votre subvention, Économies réalisées sur 3 mois, Reste à financer, Nouvelle mensualité, Mensualité initiale, and Revente de surplus based on kit power. Modifications to text labels (e.g., EDF addition, Organisme de financement replacement) and a specific calculation for Restant sur la facture based on meter power were also specified.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing a new amortization table feature within the  application. This task was initiated by the user requesting an amortization table visually identical to their old software, with specific calculation requirements.

The work progressed as follows:
1.  **Initial Plan Confirmation (Chat Message 6):** The AI engineer confirmed understanding of the user's precise visual and calculation requirements for the amortization table, including its placement in the Analyse financière tab and the use of existing app data.
2.  **Visual Correction Iteration (Chat Message 34-39):** After an initial attempt, the user reported that the visual reproduction was incorrect and provided reference images. The engineer acknowledged the mistake, identifying that the previous attempt used a modern grid layout instead of the precise rectangular cases, specific positioning, and arrows of the old software.
3.  **HTML and CSS Refinement:** To address the visual discrepancies, the engineer made changes to both  (Chat Message 38) and  (Chat Message 36) to rebuild the amortization table's structure and styling. The aim was to achieve a pixel-perfect match, including elements like the 6 mois = 0€ section and the ÉCO-FINANCEMENT = TRANSFERT DE CHARGES section.
4.  **Frontend Visual Confirmation (Chat Message 40-41):** A frontend test was conducted, which successfully confirmed that the new amortization table now accurately reproduces the visual design of the user's old software. The application is functional and the backend was also confirmed to be working correctly.

The current state is that the amortization table has been successfully integrated into the Analyse financière tab with the exact desired visual layout and styling, matching the provided reference images. The next step is to implement the detailed financial calculations within this visually complete structure.
