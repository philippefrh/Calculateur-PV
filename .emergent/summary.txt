The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from a visually enhanced prototype to a functional tool with critical business logic. Initially, efforts focused on refining the  with dynamic visual elements like the sun, Linky meter, and animated banknotes. Subsequently, a significant update involved adjusting Martinique's solar panel kit pricing, introducing new kit sizes, revising aid amounts, correcting the interest rate, and changing panel wattage to 375W. A key architectural decision was to ensure frontend data consistency by explicitly returning  from the backend API. The most recent major feature was the implementation of a discount mechanism, initially a single R button for a €1000 reduction. This has now evolved into three mutually exclusive buttons (R1, R2, R3) for €1000, €2000, and €3000 discounts, which are integrated into backend calculations but are explicitly hidden from the final quote. The backend for these new discounts is validated, and the current work is on frontend visual testing, which is paused due to a form validation issue.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. Initial requirements focused on PDF enhancements and UI consistency, including a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation features an animated sun, a real-time kWh Linky meter, a persistent mobile phone with synchronized kWh values, and an animated sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies text followed by stacking euro banknotes. Specific visual styling includes repositioning the phone (right: 80px), Linky meter (left: 30%, 200x400px), ensuring no panel overlap, and styling Autoconsommation = Économies and Installation terminée ! badges with a green background and white text. A problematic power cable was removed.

Subsequently, the user requested updates to Martinique panel pack pricing: a new list of TTC prices, a confirmed TVA of 2.10%, and a recalculation of the credit interest rate from 8% to 8.63%. This involved updating existing kits (3kW, 6kW, 9kW), adding 6 new kits (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW) with corresponding prices and aid amounts, and adjusting calculations based on a panel power of 375W (instead of 500W). The latest requirement expanded on a discrete R button for a €1000 discount. It now demands three mutually exclusive buttons (R1, R2, R3) on each kit selection card to apply €1000, €2000, or €3000 reductions, respectively. These discounts must reflect in subsequent calculations but must not appear on the final quote.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing and testing an enhancement to the discount functionality. The previous single R button for a €1000 discount was replaced with three mutually exclusive buttons: R1 (for €1000), R2 (for €2000), and R3 (for €3000).

On the frontend ( and ), the  component was updated to manage a  state, ensuring only one discount (R1, R2, R3, or none) can be active at a time. The UI was modified to render these three distinct buttons, and the price display logic was adjusted to dynamically show the original price (struck through) and the new discounted price based on the selected reduction. Styles in  were updated to accommodate the new button group and individual button styling. The  and  functions were adapted to pass the selected discount type to the backend.

On the backend (), the  API endpoint was modified to accept a  parameter. The  and  functions were updated to correctly apply this  in all financial calculations. During backend testing with , an issue was identified where monthly payments were not decreasing correctly with higher discounts. This was resolved by fixing the  function to properly use the optimal financing duration for applying the discount, rather than a fixed target payment. Backend tests now confirm the R1/R2/R3 discount system works for all kits, with monthly payments correctly reflecting the reductions.

The work is currently at the stage of verifying the frontend implementation. The AI engineer attempted to take screenshots to visually confirm the new buttons and price displays but encountered an error during form navigation, specifically a missing Prénom field in an earlier step of the application flow. The engineer is now blocked on this form validation issue before proceeding with visual verification of the discount buttons.
