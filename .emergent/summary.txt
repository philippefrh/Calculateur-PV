The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from critical bug fixes to significant UI/UX enhancements. Initial work addressed navigation, geocoding timeouts, financial calculations, and kit lookup issues, stabilizing the MVP. Subsequently, the focus shifted entirely to enriching the  page. The engineer iteratively implemented a realistic sun, a real-time kWh counter with a Linky meter, integrated a permanent mobile app display with synchronized production/consumption, and an animated sequence of accumulating banknotes. The most recent interaction involved specific visual layout adjustments: repositioning the phone, resizing the Linky meter to match the phone while creating space for banknotes, and re-locating the Autoconsommation = Économies text under a new logo. The engineer successfully executed these changes across  and , including adjusting panel positions to prevent overlap. After testing via a dedicated  file, which showed the new elements correctly positioned, a final adjustment was made to center the banknotes. The work completed these visual refinements, enhancing the animated savings visualization.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique, supporting Realistic and Optimistic modes. The initial build focused on PDF enhancements, a solid green background, UI consistency, and a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation (). This animation displays after a Calcul terminé avec succès screen and leads to a financial summary. Recent user requirements for the  page centered on visual enhancements: an animated sun; a real-time kWh Linky meter appearing after panel installation with floating kWh figures; persistent, same-sized Linky meter and mobile phone display with a connecting cable; synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh values on the phone; and a final visual sequence of Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text followed by animated banknotes stacking up. The latest task involved repositioning the mobile phone to the right, resizing the Linky meter to match the phone while ensuring no panel overlap, creating central space for animated banknotes, and displaying the Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture text within a new badge, styled identically to the Installation terminée ! Système opérationnel ! logo.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Frontend environment variables;  for API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed premature  in , corrected navigation button logic (Modifier les données, Retour aux Résultats, Nouvelle Étude), added Voir toutes les options de financement button, re-added financial/technical synthesis content to step 7, and updated API call to  to pass .

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Application styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added CSS styles for the new financing button and various elements for the enhanced solar animation, including sun, Linky meter, kWh particles, cable, and banknotes.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: React component for the CSS-based 3D-like animation of solar panels. This file has been the primary focus of recent development and received numerous updates.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Corrected Retour aux Résultats button  handler.
        -   Integrated sun animation logic, Linky meter component and kWh flow, persistent phone, and cable connection visuals.
        -   Implemented logic for synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh values on the phone screen.
        -   **Most Recent Changes**: Implemented logic to reposition the phone (), adjusted Linky meter position () to match phone size (200x400px) and create space between them for banknotes. Added a new badge/logo for Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture and its display logic, mimicking the existing Installation terminée! badge. Updated banknote rendering logic to display specific euro denominations (50€, 20€, 10€, 5€) and their realistic animations. Finally, adjusted solar panel positions across different configurations (6, 12, 18 panels) to prevent overlap with the newly positioned Linky and phone elements.

    -   **Summary**: Specific styles for the  component.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive additions and modifications to style the sun, Linky meter, kWh particles, cable, phone display elements.
    -   **Most Recent Changes**: Added/modified CSS rules for the new positions and sizes of the phone and Linky meter, ensuring the visual spacing is correct. Implemented styles for the new Autoconsommation = Économies badge to visually align with the Installation terminée! badge. Crucially, added detailed CSS for the real euro banknotes (5€, 10€, 20€, 50€), including their distinct colors (grey, red/orange, blue, rose/magenta), gradients, and keyframe animations for realistic falling and stacking effects.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a series of comprehensive enhancements to the  page, transforming it into a dynamic, pedagogical visualization. The work successfully integrated a realistic, animated sun; a real-time Linky meter displaying increasing kWh values with particles flowing from panels; a persistently visible mobile phone showing synchronized green (production) and red (consumption) kWh; a visual cable connecting the last panel to the Linky meter; and an animated sequence illustrating financial savings with text and stacking banknotes.

The most recent task, specifically addressing the user's explicit requests in Chat Message 5, involved significant layout and visual refinements:
1.  **Phone Repositioning**: The mobile phone was shifted further to the right ().
2.  **Linky Meter Resizing and Repositioning**: The Linky meter was resized to match the phone's dimensions (200x400px) and repositioned () to avoid overlapping solar panels, while also creating sufficient central space.
3.  **Banknote Space**: The layout now ensures a clear area between the Linky meter and the phone for banknotes to animate.
4.  **New Economy Badge**: A new badge, visually identical to the Installation terminée ! Système opérationnel ! logo, was created to display the text Autoconsommation = Économies directement sur votre Facture and positioned just below the existing installation badge, appearing during the savings phase.
5.  **Realistic Banknotes**: The previous emoji-based banknotes were replaced with visually distinct, animated euro bills (5€, 10€, 20€, 50€) featuring specific colors (grey, red/orange, blue, rose/magenta respectively), gradients, and realistic falling/stacking animations within the newly created space.

These modifications primarily impacted  for logic and positioning, and  for styling, including the detailed visual properties and animations of the new elements. Panel positions were also fine-tuned to ensure compatibility with the new Linky and phone placements. A  file was created to facilitate direct visual testing of these animation improvements. The last communication indicated the successful completion of these specific visual enhancements, with the user stating they would resume tomorrow.
