The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, primarily by debugging and fixing the critical R1/R2/R3 discount system. This involved correcting calculation inaccuracies, resolving incorrect kit selections, and repairing the confirmation modal across both the React frontend and FastAPI backend. Post-stabilization, the focus shifted to implementing a new feature: realistic solar panel placement on client house photos. The engineer meticulously validated the  API for photorealistic image generation, including handling multiple user-provided roof images and ensuring the desired black panels rendering. Backend integration for image upload and roof analysis was completed, followed by initial frontend UI development for a new Visualisation de Toit tab. A significant frontend navigation bug, preventing progression to the results screen, was identified and promptly fixed, leaving the application poised for further frontend integration and testing of the new visualization feature.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique. Core features include a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar animation displaying sun, Linky meter, kWh values, euro banknotes, and an Autoconsommation = Économies badge (375W panel wattage). Martinique-specific pricing was updated to include new TTC prices, 2.10% TVA, 8.63% interest, and support for 12kW, 15kW, 18kW, 21kW, 24kW, 27kW kits with corresponding prices and aid amounts. A key implemented feature is three mutually exclusive discount buttons (R1: €1000, R2: €2000, R3: €3000) that apply to calculations but are hidden from the final quote. A new, major requirement is to integrate realistic solar panel placement on client house photos, demanding photorealistic rendering equivalent to provided examples, with a specific request for black-colored panels.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the critical phase of fixing the R1/R2/R3 discount system, ensuring discounts are accurately applied and displayed. The application now correctly reflects  and handles kit selection and confirmation modal flows.

The current ongoing work revolves around implementing the new realistic solar panel placement feature. The AI engineer has successfully validated the integration with , confirming its ability to generate photorealistic images with solar panels, including the specific request for black panels. This was confirmed by a test () that successfully added 12 black panels to a user-provided photo.

**Backend ():**
The backend has been extended to support image uploads and roof analysis. This includes new Pydantic models for request/response bodies, utility functions for interacting with  (e.g., ) and S3 for image storage, and two new API endpoints:
-   : For receiving and storing client roof images.
-   : For processing an uploaded image via  to add solar panels and returning the result.
These backend changes have been implemented and successfully tested.

**Frontend (, ):**
The frontend has been updated to include a new Visualisation de Toit tab within the . A placeholder  component has been created and integrated. Necessary CSS for this new section has been added to .

**Recent Bug Fix:**
A critical bug preventing the application from proceeding from the PVGIS calculation step (step 4) to the results screen (step 5) was identified. The application was incorrectly skipping to the animation screen (step 6). This was fixed by changing  to  in  (around line 2754), and the associated timer was reduced from 20 to 5 seconds. The AI engineer has just completed this fix and is about to re-test the frontend flow.
