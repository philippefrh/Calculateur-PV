The AI engineer's work transitioned FRH ENVIRONNEMENT from a prototype, enhancing animations, updating Martinique pricing, and implementing a complex R1/R2/R3 discount system with backend validation. A major focus was integrating PDF quote generation, which became a significant challenge. Despite multiple attempts to replicate the original PDF's design (using ReportLab and PyPDF2 for recreation and overlays), all failed to meet user expectations for visual fidelity due to the technical complexity of pixel-perfect replication. This led to the PDF task being temporarily abandoned. Concurrently, debugging the R1/R2/R3 discount system revealed issues in frontend event handling, data passing to the backend, and visual updates, leading to a deregulated state as reported by the user. The AI engineer is currently in a deep debugging phase for the R1/R2/R3 system, specifically addressing incorrect kit selection and discount application in the final calculation.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation and quote generation tool for France and Martinique. Initial requirements included a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar panel animation () with specific visual elements (animated sun, Linky meter, persistent phone, kWh values, euro banknotes, Autoconsommation = Économies badge). Panel wattage was set to 375W. Martinique panel pack pricing required updates: new TTC prices, 2.10% TVA, 8.63% interest rate, and expansion to include 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 kW kits with corresponding prices and aid amounts. A crucial feature was the implementation of three mutually exclusive discount buttons (R1: €1000, R2: €2000, R3: €3000) that apply to calculations but are hidden from the final quote. A significant recent requirement was to integrate dynamic PDF quote generation into the application, transforming an existing Syrius Martinique quote PDF by replacing company details with FRH Martinique information, maintaining the original design, and injecting dynamic client and calculation data across specific pages (1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11, plus 3 Powernity pages for page 6).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep-debugging the R1/R2/R3 discount functionality, specifically after the user reported that no modification nor discount works and the software was completely deregulated.

The user's latest feedback indicated:
1.  **Visual changes (prices) now appear on the frontend**, meaning the  updates to show  and  are working for display.
2.  However, the **discount is still NOT taken into account in the *final calculation*** after confirming the kit.
3.  Furthermore, selecting a 6kW kit with a discount (e.g., R3) still results in the final calculation being performed for a **9kW kit at full price**.
4.  A new critical issue emerged: the **confirmation modal itself is now broken**, preventing the user from proceeding with the selection.

The AI engineer's current steps involve adding extensive debug logs within  to trace the data flow:
-   In , to confirm the 's power and discount amounts.
-   In , to verify what  and  values are being sent in the final API call to the backend.

The engineer is currently waiting for the user to execute these steps and report the console output from the latest debug logs to pinpoint where the  data (power and discount) is being lost or incorrectly transmitted to the backend, or why the confirmation modal is not appearing.

I will continue debugging the R1/R2/R3 discount issue by analyzing the console logs provided by the user from the latest debug statements.
