The AI engineer's trajectory shows a focused effort on the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application. Initially, work concentrated on implementing a progressive battery charge/discharge animation in  and , involving iterative styling and logic adjustments to meet visual requirements. This phase was interrupted by a critical Erreur lors du chargement des kits issue. The focus then shifted to resolving significant front-end financial display bugs in , where fields like Reste à financer, Investissement après aides, and Options de financement were showing incorrect or empty values, especially when the battery feature was active. The engineer successfully corrected these calculations to reflect  and  accurately, which the user confirmed as working. The conversation ended with the user initiating a new request for integrating an amortization table, providing an example image and awaiting further clarification.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, designed for clients in France and Martinique, facilitates solar calculation and quote generation. Key features include dynamic CSS 3D solar animations, region-specific pricing (Martinique: TTC, TVA, interest), solar kits (12kW-27kW), government aids, and a three-tier discount system. A requirement is the automatic display of the CSS animation post-Carré VERT positif screen after a 7-second delay. Financial logic was refined to align with monthly savings, adding an Économie column.

The most recent core feature implemented before this trajectory was an optional Batterie button that adds 5000€ to the kit price and integrates a battery image into the CSS animation. During this trajectory, the user explicitly requested enhancing the battery feature with a progressive charge/discharge animation (0-100% in 5% increments, then inverse, then loop), synchronized with panel production. Visual requirements included ensuring the green percentage label moves with the charge, is not hidden by the Linky meter, and the battery image is enlarged to match the Linky's size. Subsequent work also involved resolving financial display inconsistencies caused by the battery option.

-   ****: Stores  and .
-   ****: Contains core backend logic for API routes, solar calculations, and financing. It handles the  parameter by adding 5000€ to . No direct code changes were made in this trajectory, but its backend functionality was implicitly confirmed.
-   ****: Stores  for frontend API calls.
-   ****: The primary React component managing UI, state, user flow, kit selection, and financial result display.
    -   **Importance**: Central to user interaction and data presentation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive debugging logs were added to  to diagnose kit loading issues. Crucially, fixes for financial display inconsistencies were implemented:  now correctly uses  when  is true, and Reste à financer and Investissement après aides fields are explicitly calculated as  to ensure accurate display.
-   ****: Defines global application styles. No direct changes in this trajectory relevant to the problem at hand.
-   ****: React component responsible for rendering and managing the dynamic 3D solar panel animation and battery elements.
    -   **Importance**: Manages the visual presentation and interactive behavior of the animation, particularly the battery charge.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated a conditional  for the battery image. Multiple iterations of refactoring were done for the progressive battery charge/discharge animation logic, utilizing  and  to manage  (0-100% in 5% steps) and . A  JSX element was added, conditionally rendered.
-   ****: Manages styles for the CSS animation elements, controlling their visual presentation, positioning, and sizing.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for the visual accuracy and responsiveness of the animation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive updates included adjusting  properties for , , and  for left shifting; modifying  and  for  and  to resize the battery image and fine-tuning  and  properties for precise alignment; repositioning the percentage label ( property) for full visibility; and adding new CSS rules for the  for positioning and styling.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical front-end display issues within the  application, specifically regarding financial calculations when the optional battery storage feature was selected. The primary goal was to fix three identified problems in : Reste à financer appearing empty, Options de financement showing an incorrect price (15900€ instead of 20900€ with battery), and Investissement après aides appearing empty.

To address these, the engineer modified :
-   For Options de financement, the display logic was updated to use  (which includes battery cost) when  was true, ensuring the correct total price.
-   For Reste à financer and Investissement après aides, the calculation was explicitly set to . This direct calculation ensured values were always displayed correctly, bypassing potential issues with .

Before these financial fixes, significant effort was also put into implementing and debugging a progressive battery charge/discharge animation. This involved multiple refactorings of animation logic in  and styling adjustments in  to achieve the desired visual effect (e.g., precise sizing, positioning, percentage display). Although the animation code logic was functional, a larger Erreur lors du chargement des kits issue emerged, causing a pivot to the financial display bugs. The user confirmed the successful resolution of these financial display issues.
