The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application from initial bug fixes and design enhancements to a complex AI-powered solar panel placement feature. The core work involved integrating OpenAI Vision API for roof image analysis and then iteratively refining the image generation process. Initial issues included  conflicts, CSS consistency, and PDF generation. The main challenge was the Insérer photos de la toiture feature. The AI engineer faced and resolved critical backend errors (, Pydantic validation) and a major architectural shift from attempting AI-driven image generation (which OpenAI Vision cannot do) to implementing a robust, local Python (Pillow) solution for superimposing realistic, perspective-corrected solar panels on uploaded roof images. User frustration regarding wasted credits and unconvincing results led to multiple debugging cycles, including a crucial intervention from the  to identify an OpenAI response parsing issue. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by abandoning a planned  integration due to user concerns about additional costs, instead enhancing the existing solution.

<product_requirements>
The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is a solar calculation tool designed for France and Martinique, providing financial projections and automated PDF quotes. The application supports Realistic and Optimistic modes and generates branded PDF quotes.

Key user requests and addressed issues include:
*   **PDF Enhancements**: Integrate FRH logo, correct footer address, set specific text colors (green/black) for délai de livraison and offre valable, and revert TVA calculation logic (20% France, 2.1% Martinique).
*   **Frontend Visuals**: Implement a solid green background () with dynamic animated effects (floating particles, luminous ripples) and adjustable intensity.
*   **Success Screen**: Extend display duration to 20 seconds, enlarge the central visual, and update the phrase to Ce % déconomie **et dautonomie** de couleur verte....
*   **UI Consistency**: Standardize the height of Étude 1 and Étude 2 logos to 74px.
*   **New Feature (Roof Analysis)**: At step 4/4, add an Insérer photos de la toiture button. Upon photo upload, use AI (OpenAI Vision) to analyze the roof image and automatically calculate/virtually position 6, 12, or 18 solar panels (each 2.11m²) with a realistic final render.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into refining the Insérer photos de la toiture feature, specifically addressing the realism and accurate placement of solar panels on uploaded roof images.

The work revolved around several critical fixes and enhancements:
1.  **OpenAI Response Parsing**: A major issue was identified (with 's help) where OpenAI was returning analysis results within text (e.g., markdown code blocks) rather than pure JSON. This caused the backend to use generic panel positions instead of AI-calculated ones. The engineer implemented robust parsing using regex to reliably extract the JSON payload, ensuring the AI's precise panel placement recommendations are utilized.
2.  **Realistic Panel Rendering (Pillow)**: The user expressed dissatisfaction with panels looking like simple black rectangles. The engineer initially considered  for external image generation but, respecting user's concerns about additional costs, significantly enhanced the existing Pillow-based  function in .
3.  **Perspective and Geometry Correction**: The final major refinement involved ensuring panels were not floating but accurately followed the roof's inclination and perspective. This was achieved by modifying the drawing logic in  to render panels as parallelograms, adjust their size based on perspective, and ensure they are placed within the actual roof area (e.g., 18% to 55% of the image height). Features like shadows, metallic frames, detailed cells, and reflections were added to enhance realism.
4.  **Frontend Display**:  was updated to correctly display the  received from the backend, providing a realistic visual representation of solar panels installed on the uploaded roof.

The current state is that the backend is now generating a highly realistic, perspective-corrected composite image with solar panels superimposed on the user's uploaded roof photo, directly addressing the user's explicit visual quality requirements without incurring additional third-party API costs.
