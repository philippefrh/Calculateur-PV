The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application, particularly by fixing the R1/R2/R3 discount system and initiating a new solar panel placement feature using . Backend integration for image upload and roof analysis was completed, along with initial frontend UI for a Visualisation de Toit tab.

The current trajectory details the debugging process undertaken by the AI engineer. The primary issue reported by the user was a persistent blockage at the PVGIS calculation step. Investigation revealed a critical backend failure due to an unreachable MongoDB instance, as the  was incorrectly set to  instead of . This was corrected, and the backend API then functioned. Subsequently, a frontend navigation error, linked to a hardcoded preview URL for the backend in  and , was identified. This was addressed by modifying the  to use the correct internal IP for backend communication. The application's core functionality, including the calculation and navigation to results, is now reported as working.

The FRH ENVIRONNEMENT application is designed as a solar calculation and quote generation tool for clients in France and Martinique. Its core features include a dynamic CSS-based 3D solar animation that visually represents energy flow (sun, Linky meter, kWh, euro banknotes) using 375W panels, with an Autoconsommation = Économies badge. Martinique-specific pricing has been implemented, incorporating new TTC prices, 2.10% TVA, 8.63% interest rates, and support for various kit sizes (12kW to 27kW) with corresponding prices and aid amounts. A crucial functional requirement is the inclusion of three mutually exclusive discount buttons (R1: €1000, R2: €2000, R3: €3000) that apply to calculations but remain hidden from the final quote. A major new feature under development requires integrating realistic solar panel placement on client house photos, demanding photorealistic rendering and specifically black-colored panels.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Summary**: Critical for configuring database connections and external API keys.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added to enable  integration. Crucially,  was changed from  to  to resolve database connectivity issues.
-   ****: The core FastAPI backend handling API routes and business logic.
    -   **Summary**: Manages client data, kit pricing, financing, and integrates with  for image generation.
    *   **Changes Made**: Initial fixes ensured discount and pricing calculations. New Pydantic models (, , ) and utility functions (, , , ) were added for roof visualization. New API endpoints  and  were created and validated.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Summary**: Ensures all necessary Python libraries for the backend are available.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added.
-   ****: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Summary**: Crucial for setting the  for API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was initially found hardcoded to a preview URL and was adjusted during debugging to resolve frontend connectivity issues, though the exact final value after the last attempts is not explicitly stated in the trajectory, the intent was to ensure it points to the correct backend IP or domain.
-   ****: The main React component for UI, state, and backend interactions.
    -   **Summary**: Orchestrates user flow, displays results, and handles animations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Discount system fixes were implemented. A new Visualisation de Toit tab and  component were introduced. A critical navigation bug from PVGIS calculation to results screen (step 4 to 5) was fixed by changing  to  and reducing the PVGIS timer to 5 seconds. Debugging logs for  were temporarily added.
-   ****: Defines application-wide styling.
    -   **Summary**: Provides visual theme and layout for the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: New styles were added to support roof visualization elements and responsive design.
-   ****: Used for documenting testing protocols and communication.
    -   **Summary**: Tracks issues, fixes, and backend test results.
    -   **Changes Made**: Regularly updated to log debugging efforts, including the  test success, the MongoDB connection issue, and the frontend URL problems and their resolutions.

<pending_tasks>
-   **PDF Quote Generation**: Temporarily abandoned due to design replication challenges.
-   **Deferred Feature**: Implement dual application versions for Particuliers (Individuals) and Professionnels (Professionals).
-   **New Feature Continuation**: Complete frontend logic for image upload, displaying the  processed images, and connecting it to the existing kit selection system.
-   **Frontend Test**: Create a simple frontend test to verify successful navigation to the results screen after form submission.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving critical application errors that prevented proper navigation and data submission. The primary issues identified and addressed were:

1.  **MongoDB Connection Failure**: The backend was failing with 500 errors due to an incorrect  configuration (). This was resolved by updating the  file to , which re-established database connectivity and allowed backend APIs to function correctly.
2.  **Frontend Navigation Bug**: The application was getting stuck at the PVGIS calculation step (step 4), failing to navigate to the results screen (step 5). This was linked to a previous fix where  was incorrectly set instead of  in  and an associated 20-second timer was reduced to 5 seconds.
3.  **Frontend Backend URL Configuration**: An error indicated that the frontend's  was hardcoded to a preview URL, causing connectivity issues in the deployed environment. While the exact final value isn't explicitly shown, the engineer iteratively attempted to correct it, aiming to use the correct internal IP or system-provided external URL to ensure frontend-backend communication.

The current status is that the MongoDB connection is fixed, and the backend API calls are successful. The application is now expected to navigate correctly to the results screen, resolving the core blocking issues reported by the user. The previous AI engineer had also integrated  for photorealistic solar panel placement, with backend support for image upload () and analysis () already validated. Initial frontend UI for this Visualisation de Toit tab exists, but the full integration of image upload and display remains to be completed.
