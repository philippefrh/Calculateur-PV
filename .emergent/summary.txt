The previous AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP solar calculation application, meticulously integrating numerous user-requested enhancements. Key achievements included dynamic CO2 emission calculations, refinement of UI texts and financial displays (e.g., annual payments), updates to financing vignette text, and more descriptive autonomy percentage messages. Significant functional additions encompassed enabling multi-selection for heating systems, expanding appliance input fields, and a comprehensive visual overhaul featuring a modern gradient background, glassmorphism effects, and improved button aesthetics. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills and consistently adapted to evolving requirements.
The immediate interaction, preceding this summary, centered on preparing for the next development phase: the Professional Version. The user expressed concerns about potential bugs in new versions and the ability to revert. The AI engineer proactively addressed these by explaining the available rollback and Save to GitHub options, recommending the latter for a secure backup. The conversation concluded with the user's explicit agreement to proceed with a save point, followed by an ok acknowledging the proposed approach, setting the stage for future development.

<product_requirements>
FRH ENVIRONNEMENT aims to evolve an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB solar calculation MVP into a professional tool. The core problem is enhancing functionality, accuracy, and user experience for solar installation calculations.

Key requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **Financial Calculation Correction**: Accurate interest (3.25% TAEG) for optimized financing options.
2.  **UI/PDF Refinement**: Removing Coût total from tables, adding Financement avec aides déduites tables (3.25% interest, 6-15 years).
3.  **Autoconsumption Ratio Adjustment**: Updated from 70/30 to 95/5 for perceived savings.
4.  **Logo Integration**: Displaying official logos (RGE, AGIR PLUS EDF, FRH, MMA, FFB) with appropriate styling.
5.  **Educational Pages**: Interactive content during PVGIS calculation.
6.  **Manual Kit Selection**: Allowing sales personnel to select kits with detailed info (power, panels, surface, TTC/aids price, dynamic CO2 commission).
7.  **Ongoing Enhancements (Current Session)**: Dynamic CO2 calculation (15% of HT price), updated button text (Voir tous les kits disponibles avec puissances et surfaces), annual payment calculation (12 months, no explanatory text), financing vignette text changes (Rien à débourser pendant les 6 premiers mois, Réinjection des Aides...), clarified autonomy percentage texts, expanded heating form fields (Cheminée, Poêle, Chaudière électrique), multi-selection for heating systems, and new appliance fields (Machine à laver, Sèche linge, etc.).
8.  **Visual Improvements**: Modern gradient background, glassmorphism effects, and enhanced button styles.

<code_architecture>
The application features a standard full-stack setup: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Orchestrates the backend, handling FastAPI endpoints, MongoDB interactions, PVGIS API calls, and all financial calculations. It also manages PDF report generation.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated  for interest, new endpoint for aid-deducted kits, interest rate for specific options changed from 4.96% to 3.25%,  adjusted to 0.95, and PDF generation logic modified for OPTIONS DE FINANCEMENT AVEC AIDES DÉDUITES table.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The core React component, managing the multi-step UI, form data, API calls, and result display, including educational pages and kit selection.
    -   **Changes Made:** Display logic for financing updated, Coût total removed, new aid-deducted table added, placeholder logos replaced,  integrated, manual kit selection UI introduced (with  fix). Most recent changes include dynamic CO2 calculation (15% of HT price), updated button text, annual payment calculation (), financing vignette text modified (Rien à débourser pendant les 6 premiers mois, new line for aid reinjection), autonomy percentage texts updated, new heating system options added with multi-selection, and eight new appliance input fields.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Contains the application's visual styling.
    -   **Changes Made:** New CSS classes for logo sizing, educational pages, manual kit selection. Most recent changes include styles for multi-select heating, a modern gradient background, glassmorphism effects for cards (, subtle borders, shadows), and enhanced button styles (gradient, hover animations, 3D effect).
-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary:** Environment variable configuration files critical for deployment and service communication.
    -   **Changes Made:** No direct modifications were made; changes involved correctly reading and utilizing these variables.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Professional Version Implementation**: This major feature involves creating a dual application version (Particuliers and Professionnels).
    -   Adding a homepage toggle button to switch modes.
    -   Implementing distinct calculation methods for each mode.
    -   Integrating different kit pricing, aids, and subsidies for professionals.
    -   Developing a separate financing system for professionals (leasing).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive visual overhaul of the application, significantly modernizing its appearance. This involved extensive modifications to both  and .

**Current State of the Product (Visuals):**
*   **Background**: The application now features a striking, modern gradient background (blue/violet, e.g.,  to ) with subtle rotating rays and dynamic luminous particles, replacing the previous plain background.
*   **Cards/Forms**: UI elements like forms and information cards now exhibit a glassmorphism effect. This is achieved through  for transparency, subtle borders, and sophisticated multi-layered shadows, giving them depth and a sleek, modern look.
*   **Buttons**: Buttons across the application have been enhanced with new gradients harmonized with the background, featuring interactive light animations on hover and a subtle 3D elevation effect.
*   **Titles**: The main titles now use a gradient text effect, contributing to a cohesive and professional visual design.

**Work Done & Nuances:**
The implementation involved adding significant CSS rules to  to define the new background, card styles, and button aesthetics. Corresponding React components in  were updated to apply these new styles, for instance, by adding new class names to  elements. This visual update was confirmed through screenshots, which clearly showed the transformed UI. The user expressed strong satisfaction with the new design. This task followed a series of functional enhancements, including the dynamic CO2 calculation, updated text labels, refined annual payment display, detailed financing vignette adjustments, precise autonomy bar messaging, extended heating system options (including multi-selection), and numerous new appliance input fields.
